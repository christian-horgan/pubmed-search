# PubMed Search and Data Extraction

Using PubMed APIs in Python to find and extract publications based on specific parameters

## Description

This repository includes programs and data related to extracting PubMed publications using Python and PubMed APIs. The main purpose of the code is to set search parameters and utilize the APIs to pull publications from PubMed and store the data in an
organized dataframe. The following can be found within the repository:
  * A search_mthds.ipynb notebook containing the various function definitions related to pulling specific publication data based on the search
  * A mainprgm.ipynb notebook containing code that executes the search and stores the data into a csv file
  * A article_data_current.csv file containing the extracted data.

**This search program bases the search off of an inputted list of grant numbers. Results can vary based on the grant number used and the format of the grant number.**


### Dependencies

* The notebooks can be run either in a local IDE (ex. vscode) or within a Conda environment and running Jupyter Labs (environment.yml file included in repo).
