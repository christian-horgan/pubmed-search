37609241,Enhancing Fairness in Disease Prediction by Optimizing Multiple Domain Adversarial Networks.,PMC10441334,"Li B', 'Shi X', 'Gao H', 'Jiang X', 'Zhang K', 'Harmanci AO', 'Malin B'",doi:10.1101/2023.08.04.551906,"Fairness', 'adversarial training', 'biases', 'health disparities', 'machine learning'",,,"Predictive models in biomedicine need to ensure equitable and reliable outcomes for the populations they are applied to. Unfortunately, biases in medical predictions can lead to unfair treatment and widening disparities, underscoring the need for effective techniques to address these issues. To enhance fairness, we introduce a framework based on a Multiple Domain Adversarial Neural Network (MDANN), which incorporates multiple adversarial components. In an MDANN, an adversarial module is applied to learn a fair pattern by negative gradients back-propagating across multiple sensitive features (i.e., characteristics of individuals that should not be used to discriminate unfairly between individuals when making predictions or decisions.) We leverage loss functions based on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) to address the class imbalance, promoting equitable classification performance for minority groups (e.g., a subset of the population that is underrepresented or disadvantaged.) Moreover, we utilize pre-trained convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) to extract deep representations of data, aiming to enhance prediction accuracy and fairness. Combining these mechanisms, we alleviate biases and disparities to provide reliable and equitable disease prediction. We empirically demonstrate that the MDANN approach leads to better accuracy and fairness in predicting disease progression using brain imaging data for Alzheimer's Disease and Autism populations than state-of-the-art techniques.",HG012510,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2023

This perspective identifies potential biases in each stage of the AI life cycle, including data collection, annotation, machine learning model development, evaluation, deployment, operationalization, monitoring, and feedback integration. To mitigate these biases, we suggest involving a diverse group of stakeholders, using human-centered AI principles. Human-centered AI can help ensure that AI systems are designed and used in a way that benefits patients and society, which can reduce health disparities and inequities.

Through analysis of usage and impact metrics of software, developers can help determine user and community engagement. These metrics can be used to justify additional funding, encourage additional use, and identify unanticipated use cases. Such analyses can help define improvement areas and assist with managing project resources. However, there are challenges associated with assessing usage and impact, many of which vary widely depending on the type of software being evaluated. These challenges involve issues of distorted, exaggerated, understated, or misleading metrics, as well as ethical and security concerns. More attention to the nuances, challenges, and considerations involved in capturing impact across the diverse spectrum of biological software is needed. Furthermore, some tools may be especially beneficial to a small audience, yet may not have comparatively compelling metrics of high usage. Although some principles are generally applicable, there is not a single perfect metric or approach to effectively evaluate a software tool's impact, as this depends on aspects unique to each tool, how it is used, and how one wishes to evaluate engagement. We propose more broadly applicable guidelines (such as infrastructure that supports the usage of software and the collection of metrics about usage), as well as strategies for various types of software and resources. We also highlight outstanding issues in the field regarding how communities measure or evaluate software impact. To gain a deeper understanding of the issues hindering software evaluations, as well as to determine what appears to be helpful, we performed a survey of participants involved with scientific software projects for the Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) program funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). We also investigated software among this scientific community and others to assess how often infrastructure that supports such evaluations is implemented and how this impacts rates of papers describing usage of the software. We find that although developers recognize the utility of analyzing data related to the impact or usage of their software, they struggle to find the time or funding to support such analyses. We also find that infrastructure such as social media presence, more in-depth documentation, the presence of software health metrics, and clear information on how to contact developers seem to be associated with increased usage rates. Our findings can help scientific software developers make the most out of the evaluations of their software so that they can more fully benefit from such assessments.",HG012517,ArXiv,2023

Local ancestral origins of the coding region, immediate and distant upstream regions, and distal regulatory region were determined using RFMix with the reference panel from the 1000 Genomes Project. For each tissue, inter-individual variation of gene expression levels explained by concordant or discordant local ancestry between coding and regulatory regions was estimated. Compared to European, African descent showed more frequent change in local ancestral structure, with shorter haplotype blocks.

We sought to quantify practice-pattern variation in neurotrauma sedation management, surveying an international sample of providers. Methods: An electronic survey consisting of 56 questions was distributed internationally to neurocritical care providers utilizing the Research Electronic Data Capture platform. Descriptive statistics were used to quantitatively describe and summarize the responses. Results: Ninety-five providers from 37 countries responded. 56.8% were attending physicians with primary medical training most commonly in intensive care medicine (68.4%) and anesthesiology (26.3%). Institutional sedation guidelines for TBI patients were available in 43.2%. Most common sedative agents for induction and maintenance, respectively, were propofol (87.5% and 88.4%), opioids (60.2% and 70.5%), and benzodiazepines (53.4% and 68.4%). Induction and maintenance sedatives, respectively, are mostly chosen according to provider preference (68.2% and 58.9%) rather than institutional guidelines (26.1% and 35.8%). Sedation duration for patients with intracranial hypertension ranged from 24 h to 14 days. Neurological wake-up testing (NWT) was routinely performed in 70.5%. The most common NWT frequency was every 24 h (47.8%), although 20.8% performed NWT at least every 2 h. Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale targets varied from deep sedation (34.7%) to alert and calm (17.9%). Conclusions: Among critically ill TBI patients, sedation management follows provider preference rather than institutional sedation guidelines. Wide practice-pattern variation exists for the type, duration, and target of sedative management and NWT performance. Future comparative effectiveness research investigating these differences may help optimize sedation strategies to promote recovery.",OD032701,Journal of intensive care medicine,2023

Patients were identified using electronic health records (EHR) taking hydroxychloroquine and were seen by optometrists, retinal specialists, and non-retinal ophthalmologists. Review of EHR data includes demographic characteristics, indications, and dosing profile of hydroxychloroquine use, eye care provider managing the patient, and imaging modalities performed. A total of 166 patients were included in the study. The most common indications for screening were systemic lupus erythematosus and discoid lupus (52.4%) followed by rheumatoid arthritis (18.7%) and Sjögren's syndrome (9.6%). Ninety-two (55.4%) patients were on a higher-than-recommended dose of > 5 mg/kg/day. Patients who weighed less (mean 63.9 kg) were taking a higher-than-recommended dose (vs. 81.5 kg, p < 0.001). Although retinal specialists adhered best to the use of all three recommended imaging modalities, visual field testing was done appropriately for only 8.3% of Asian and 71.1% of non-Asian patients.

For addressing the immense screening burden, artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms have been developed to autonomously screen for DR from fundus photography without human input. Over the last 10 years, many AI algorithms have achieved good sensitivity and specificity (>85%) for detection of referable DR compared with human graders; however, many questions still remain. In this narrative review on AI in DR screening, we discuss key concepts in AI algorithm development as a background for understanding the algorithms. We present the AI algorithms that have been prospectively validated against human graders and demonstrate the variability of reference standards and cohort demographics. We review the limited head-to-head validation studies where investigators attempt to directly compare the available algorithms. Next, we discuss the literature regarding cost-effectiveness, equity and bias, and medicolegal considerations, all of which play a role in the implementation of these AI algorithms in clinical practice. Lastly, we highlight ongoing efforts to bridge gaps in AI model data sets to pursue equitable development and delivery.",OD032644,Diabetes care,2023

Here we evaluate the ability of OpenAI's GPT-4, a Large Language Model (LLM), to develop hypotheses about common gene functions from its embedded biomedical knowledge. We created a GPT-4 pipeline to label gene sets with names that summarize their consensus functions, substantiated by analysis text and citations. Benchmarking against named gene sets in the Gene Ontology, GPT-4 generated very similar names in 50% of cases, while in most remaining cases it recovered the name of a more general concept. In gene sets discovered in 'omics data, GPT-4 names were more informative than gene set enrichment, with supporting statements and citations that largely verified in human review. The ability to rapidly synthesize common gene functions positions LLMs as valuable functional genomics assistants.",OD032742,ArXiv,2023

An ongoing challenge is to determine the proteins orchestrating DDR and their organization into complexes, including constitutive interactions and those responding to genomic insult. Here, we use multi-conditional network analysis to systematically map DDR assemblies at multiple scales. Affinity purifications of 21 DDR proteins, with/without genotoxin exposure, are combined with multi-omics data to reveal a hierarchical organization of 605 proteins into 109 assemblies. The map captures canonical repair mechanisms and proposes new DDR-associated proteins extending to stress, transport, and chromatin functions. We find that protein assemblies closely align with genetic dependencies in processing specific genotoxins and that proteins in multiple assemblies typically act in multiple genotoxin responses. Follow-up by DDR functional readouts newly implicates 12 assembly members in double-strand-break repair. The DNA damage response assemblies map is available for interactive visualization and query (ccmi.org/ddram/).",OD032742,Cell systems,2023

We dissect CDK perturbations using single-cell RNAseq, for which we develop a novel computational framework to precisely quantify cell-cycle effects and diverse cell states orchestrated by specific CDKs. While pairwise disruption of CDK4/6 is synthetic-lethal, only CDK6 is required for normal cell-cycle progression and transcriptional activation. Multiple CDKs (CDK1/7/9/12) are synthetic-lethal in combination with PRMT5, independent of cell-cycle control. In-depth analysis of mRNA expression and splicing patterns provides multiple lines of evidence that the CDK-PRMT5 dependency is due to aberrant transcriptional regulation resulting in premature termination. These inter-dependencies translate to drug-drug synergies, with therapeutic implications in cancer and other diseases.",OD032742,Scientific reports,2023

In addition, RNA-targeting drugs have been developed for diseases with significant unmet medical needs through selective mRNA knockdown or modulation of pre-mRNA splicing. Recently, RNA editing, particularly antisense RNA-guided adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR)-based programmable A-to-I editing, has emerged as a powerful tool to manipulate RNA to enable correction of disease-causing mutations and modulate gene expression and protein function. Beyond correcting pathogenic mutations, the technology is particularly well suited for therapeutic applications that require a transient pharmacodynamic effect, such as the treatment of acute pain, obesity, viral infection, and inflammation, where it would be undesirable to introduce permanent alterations to the genome. Furthermore, transient modulation of protein function, such as altering the active sites of enzymes or the interface of protein-protein interactions, opens the door to therapeutic avenues ranging from regenerative medicine to oncology. These emerging RNA-editing-based toolsets are poised to broadly impact biotechnology and therapeutic applications.
