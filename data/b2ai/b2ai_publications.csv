The severity of MS disease is monitored by the Expanded Disability Status Scale, composed of several functional sub-scores. Early and accurate classification of MS disease severity is critical for slowing down or preventing disease progression via applying early therapeutic intervention strategies. Recent advances in deep learning and the wide use of Electronic Health Records (EHR) create opportunities to apply data-driven and predictive modeling tools for this goal. Previous studies focusing on using single-modal machine learning and deep learning algorithms were limited in terms of prediction accuracy due to data insufficiency or model simplicity. In this paper, we proposed the idea of using patients' multimodal longitudinal and longitudinal EHR data to predict multiple sclerosis disease severity in the future. Our contribution has two main facets. First, we describe a pioneering effort to integrate structured EHR data, neuroimaging data and clinical notes to build a multi-modal deep learning framework to predict patient's MS severity. The proposed pipeline demonstrates up to 19% increase in terms of the area under the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC) compared to models using single-modal data. Second, the study also provides valuable insights regarding the amount useful signal embedded in each data modality with respect to MS disease prediction, which may improve data collection processes.",HG012510,BMC medical informatics and decision making,2023

Unfortunately, biases in medical predictions can lead to unfair treatment and widening disparities, underscoring the need for effective techniques to address these issues. To enhance fairness, we introduce a framework based on a Multiple Domain Adversarial Neural Network (MDANN), which incorporates multiple adversarial components. In an MDANN, an adversarial module is applied to learn a fair pattern by negative gradients back-propagating across multiple sensitive features (i.e., characteristics of individuals that should not be used to discriminate unfairly between individuals when making predictions or decisions.) We leverage loss functions based on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) to address the class imbalance, promoting equitable classification performance for minority groups (e.g., a subset of the population that is underrepresented or disadvantaged.) Moreover, we utilize pre-trained convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) to extract deep representations of data, aiming to enhance prediction accuracy and fairness. Combining these mechanisms, we alleviate biases and disparities to provide reliable and equitable disease prediction. We empirically demonstrate that the MDANN approach leads to better accuracy and fairness in predicting disease progression using brain imaging data for Alzheimer's Disease and Autism populations than state-of-the-art techniques.",HG012510,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2023

Methods and Results We developed and externally validated a checklist risk score to predict in-hospital mortality among adults admitted to the cardiac intensive care unit with Society for Cardiovascular Angiography & Interventions Shock Stage C or greater cardiogenic shock using 2 real-world data sets and Risk-Calibrated Super-sparse Linear Integer Modeling (RiskSLIM). We compared this model to those developed using conventional penalized logistic regression and published cardiogenic shock and intensive care unit mortality prediction models. There were 8815 patients in our training cohort (in-hospital mortality 13.4%) and 2237 patients in our validation cohort (in-hospital mortality 22.8%), and there were 39 candidate predictor variables. The final risk score (termed BOS,MA2) included maximum blood urea nitrogen ≥25 mg/dL, minimum oxygen saturation <88%, minimum systolic blood pressure <80 mm Hg, use of mechanical ventilation, age ≥60 years, and maximum anion gap ≥14 mmol/L, based on values recorded during the first 24 hours of intensive care unit stay. Predicted in-hospital mortality ranged from 0.5% for a score of 0 to 70.2% for a score of 6. The area under the receiver operating curve was 0.83 (0.82-0.84) in training and 0.76 (0.73-0.78) in validation, and the expected calibration error was 0.9% in training and 2.6% in validation. Conclusions Developed using a novel machine learning method and the largest cardiogenic shock cohorts among published models, BOS,MA2 is a simple, clinically interpretable risk score that has improved performance compared with existing cardiogenic-shock risk scores and better calibration than general intensive care unit risk scores.",HG012510,Journal of the American Heart Association,2023

Through analysis of usage and impact metrics of software, developers can help determine user and community engagement. These metrics can be used to justify additional funding, encourage additional use, and identify unanticipated use cases. Such analyses can help define improvement areas and assist with managing project resources. However, there are challenges associated with assessing usage and impact, many of which vary widely depending on the type of software being evaluated. These challenges involve issues of distorted, exaggerated, understated, or misleading metrics, as well as ethical and security concerns. More attention to the nuances, challenges, and considerations involved in capturing impact across the diverse spectrum of biological software is needed. Furthermore, some tools may be especially beneficial to a small audience, yet may not have comparatively compelling metrics of high usage. Although some principles are generally applicable, there is not a single perfect metric or approach to effectively evaluate a software tool's impact, as this depends on aspects unique to each tool, how it is used, and how one wishes to evaluate engagement. We propose more broadly applicable guidelines (such as infrastructure that supports the usage of software and the collection of metrics about usage), as well as strategies for various types of software and resources. We also highlight outstanding issues in the field regarding how communities measure or evaluate software impact. To gain a deeper understanding of the issues hindering software evaluations, as well as to determine what appears to be helpful, we performed a survey of participants involved with scientific software projects for the Informatics Technology for Cancer Research (ITCR) program funded by the National Cancer Institute (NCI). We also investigated software among this scientific community and others to assess how often infrastructure that supports such evaluations is implemented and how this impacts rates of papers describing usage of the software. We find that although developers recognize the utility of analyzing data related to the impact or usage of their software, they struggle to find the time or funding to support such analyses. We also find that infrastructure such as social media presence, more in-depth documentation, the presence of software health metrics, and clear information on how to contact developers seem to be associated with increased usage rates. Our findings can help scientific software developers make the most out of the evaluations of their software so that they can more fully benefit from such assessments.",HG012517,ArXiv,2023

We sought to quantify practice-pattern variation in neurotrauma sedation management, surveying an international sample of providers. Methods: An electronic survey consisting of 56 questions was distributed internationally to neurocritical care providers utilizing the Research Electronic Data Capture platform. Descriptive statistics were used to quantitatively describe and summarize the responses. Results: Ninety-five providers from 37 countries responded. 56.8% were attending physicians with primary medical training most commonly in intensive care medicine (68.4%) and anesthesiology (26.3%). Institutional sedation guidelines for TBI patients were available in 43.2%. Most common sedative agents for induction and maintenance, respectively, were propofol (87.5% and 88.4%), opioids (60.2% and 70.5%), and benzodiazepines (53.4% and 68.4%). Induction and maintenance sedatives, respectively, are mostly chosen according to provider preference (68.2% and 58.9%) rather than institutional guidelines (26.1% and 35.8%). Sedation duration for patients with intracranial hypertension ranged from 24 h to 14 days. Neurological wake-up testing (NWT) was routinely performed in 70.5%. The most common NWT frequency was every 24 h (47.8%), although 20.8% performed NWT at least every 2 h. Richmond Agitation and Sedation Scale targets varied from deep sedation (34.7%) to alert and calm (17.9%). Conclusions: Among critically ill TBI patients, sedation management follows provider preference rather than institutional sedation guidelines. Wide practice-pattern variation exists for the type, duration, and target of sedative management and NWT performance. Future comparative effectiveness research investigating these differences may help optimize sedation strategies to promote recovery.",OD032701,Journal of intensive care medicine,2023

However, to our knowledge only few studies have explored transformers for predicting clinical outcomes from electronic health record (EHR) data, and in our estimation, none have adequately derived a health-specific tokenization scheme to fully capture the heterogeneity of EHR systems. In this study, we propose a dynamic method for tokenizing both discrete and continuous patient data, and present a transformer-based classifier utilizing a joint embedding space for integrating disparate temporal patient measurements. We demonstrate the feasibility of our clinical AI framework through multi-task ICU patient acuity estimation, where we simultaneously predict six mortality and readmission outcomes.

An ongoing challenge is to determine the proteins orchestrating DDR and their organization into complexes, including constitutive interactions and those responding to genomic insult. Here, we use multi-conditional network analysis to systematically map DDR assemblies at multiple scales. Affinity purifications of 21 DDR proteins, with/without genotoxin exposure, are combined with multi-omics data to reveal a hierarchical organization of 605 proteins into 109 assemblies. The map captures canonical repair mechanisms and proposes new DDR-associated proteins extending to stress, transport, and chromatin functions. We find that protein assemblies closely align with genetic dependencies in processing specific genotoxins and that proteins in multiple assemblies typically act in multiple genotoxin responses. Follow-up by DDR functional readouts newly implicates 12 assembly members in double-strand-break repair. The DNA damage response assemblies map is available for interactive visualization and query (ccmi.org/ddram/).",OD032742,Cell systems,2023

Here we use combinatorial CRISPR/Cas9 perturbations to uncover an extensive network of functional interdependencies among CDKs and related factors, identifying 43 synthetic-lethal and 12 synergistic interactions. We dissect CDK perturbations using single-cell RNAseq, for which we develop a novel computational framework to precisely quantify cell-cycle effects and diverse cell states orchestrated by specific CDKs. While pairwise disruption of CDK4/6 is synthetic-lethal, only CDK6 is required for normal cell-cycle progression and transcriptional activation. Multiple CDKs (CDK1/7/9/12) are synthetic-lethal in combination with PRMT5, independent of cell-cycle control. In-depth analysis of mRNA expression and splicing patterns provides multiple lines of evidence that the CDK-PRMT5 dependency is due to aberrant transcriptional regulation resulting in premature termination.

In addition, RNA-targeting drugs have been developed for diseases with significant unmet medical needs through selective mRNA knockdown or modulation of pre-mRNA splicing. Recently, RNA editing, particularly antisense RNA-guided adenosine deaminase acting on RNA (ADAR)-based programmable A-to-I editing, has emerged as a powerful tool to manipulate RNA to enable correction of disease-causing mutations and modulate gene expression and protein function. Beyond correcting pathogenic mutations, the technology is particularly well suited for therapeutic applications that require a transient pharmacodynamic effect, such as the treatment of acute pain, obesity, viral infection, and inflammation, where it would be undesirable to introduce permanent alterations to the genome. Furthermore, transient modulation of protein function, such as altering the active sites of enzymes or the interface of protein-protein interactions, opens the door to therapeutic avenues ranging from regenerative medicine to oncology. These emerging RNA-editing-based toolsets are poised to broadly impact biotechnology and therapeutic applications. Here, we review the emerging field of therapeutic RNA editing, highlight recent laboratory advancements, and discuss the key challenges on the path to clinical development.",OD032742,Molecular therapy : the journal of the American Society of Gene Therapy,2023
