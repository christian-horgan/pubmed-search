The fabrication technique is simple, yet the batch-to-batch variation of LIG quality is not well documented in the literature. In this study, we conduct experiments to characterize batch-to-batch variation in the manufacturing of LIG electrodes for applications in electrochemical sensing. Numerous batches of 36 LIG electrodes were synthesized using a CO2 laser system on polyimide film. The LIG material was characterized using goniometry, stereomicroscopy, open circuit potentiometry, and cyclic voltammetry. Hydrophobicity and electrochemical screening (cyclic voltammetry) indicate that LIG electrode batch-to-batch variation is less than 5% when using a commercial reference and counter electrode. Metallization of LIG led to a significant increase in peak current and specific capacitance (area between anodic/cathodic curve). However, batch-to-batch variation increased to approximately 30%. Two different platinum electrodeposition techniques were studied, including galvanostatic and frequency-modulated electrodeposition. The study shows that formation of metallized LIG electrodes with high specific capacitance and peak current may come at the expense of high batch variability. This design tradeoff has not been discussed in the literature and is an important consideration if scaling sensor designs for mass use is desired. This study provides important insight into the variation of LIG material properties for scalable development of LIG sensors. Additional studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanism(s) of this variability so that strategies to improve the repeatability may be developed for improving quality control. The dataset from this study is available via an open access repository.",AA029328,Micromachines,2024

Among additive manufacturing methods, screen printing is particularly desirable for high-throughput production of sensing platforms. However, this technique needs to be combined with carefully formulated inks, rapid postprocessing, and selective functionalization to meet all requirements for high-performance biosensing applications. Here, we present screen-printed graphene electrodes that are processed with thermal annealing to achieve high surface area and electrical conductivity for sensitive biodetection via electrochemical impedance spectroscopy. As a proof-of-concept, this biosensing platform is utilized for electrochemical detection of SARS-CoV-2. To ensure reliable specificity in the presence of multiple variants, biolayer interferometry (BLI) is used as a label-free and dynamic screening method to identify optimal antibodies for concurrent affinity to the Spike S1 proteins of Delta, Omicron, and Wild Type SARS-CoV-2 variants while maintaining low affinity to competing pathogens such as Influenza H1N1. The BLI-identified antibodies are robustly bound to the graphene electrode surface via oxygen moieties that are introduced during the thermal annealing process. The resulting electrochemical immunosensors achieve superior metrics including rapid detection (55 s readout following 15 min of incubation), low limits of detection (approaching 500 ag/mL for the Omicron variant), and high selectivity toward multiple variants. Importantly, the sensors perform well on clinical saliva samples detecting as few as 103 copies/mL of SARS-CoV-2 Omicron, following CDC protocols. The combination of the screen-printed graphene sensing platform and effective antibody selection using BLI can be generalized to a wide range of point-of-care immunosensors.",AA029328,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2024

However, batch-to-batch variation in LIG fabrication introduces uncertainty that cannot be adequately tracked during manufacturing process, limiting scalability. Therefore, there is an urgent need for robust quality control (QC) methodologies to identify and select similar and functional LIG electrodes for sensor fabrication. For the first time, we have developed a statistical workflow and an open-source hierarchical clustering tool for QC analysis in LIG electrode fabrication. The QC process was challenged with multi-operator cyclic voltammetry (CV) data for bare and metalized LIG. As a proof of concept, we employed the developed QC process for laboratory-scale manufacturing of LIG-based biosensors. The study demonstrates that our QC process can rapidly identify similar LIG electrodes from large batches (n ≥ 36) of electrodes, leading to a reduction in biosensor measurement variation by approximately 13% compared to the control group without QC. The statistical workflow and open-source code presented here provide a versatile toolkit for clustering analysis, opening a pathway toward scalable manufacturing of LIG electrodes in sensing.

Here, we developed a respiratory diagnostic panel to detect SARS-CoV-2, influenza A and B within a single saliva sample.

We also confirmed the stability of influenza A in saliva at room temperature for up to 5 days. The cost of the assay is lower than standard nasopharyngeal swab respiratory panel tests as saliva collection does not require specialized swabs or trained clinical personnel.

Devices integrated with electrochemical biosensors may be an interesting alternative to respond to the high demand for testing, particularly in contexts where access to standard detection technologies is lacking. Aptamers as recognition elements are useful due to their stability, specificity, and sensitivity to binding target molecules. We have developed a non-invasive electrochemical aptamer-based biosensor targeting SARS-CoV-2 in human saliva. The aptamer is expected to detect the Spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 wildtype and its variants. Laser-induced graphene (LIG) electrodes coated with platinum nanoparticles were biofunctionalized with a biotin-tagged aptamer. Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) for BA.1 sensing was conducted in sodium chloride/sodium bicarbonate solution supplemented with pooled saliva. To estimate sensing performance, the aptasensor was tested with contrived samples of UV-attenuated virions from 10 to 10,000 copies/ml. Selectivity was assessed by exposing the aptasensor to non-targeted viruses (hCoV-OC43, Influenza A, and RSV-A). EIS data outputs were further used to select a suitable response variable and cutoff frequency. Capacitance increases in response to the gradual loading of the attenuated BA.1. The aptasensor was sensitive and specific for BA.1 at a lower viral load (10-100 copies/ml) and was capable of discriminating between negative and positive contrived samples (with strain specificity against other viruses: OC43, Influenza A, and RSV-A). The aptasensor detected SARS-CoV-2 with an estimated LOD of 1790 copies/ml in contrived samples. In human clinical samples, the aptasensor presents an accuracy of 72%, with 75% of positive percent of agreement and 67% of negative percent of agreement. Our results show that the aptasensor is a promising candidate to detect SARS-CoV-2 during early stages of infection when virion concentrations are low, which may be useful for preventing the asymptomatic spread of CoVID-19.",AA029328,PloS one,2023

Currently, there are interesting opportunities for expanding the use of BLI in other fields, including the development of rapid diagnostic tools. To date, there are no detailed frameworks for implementing BLI in target-recognition studies that are pivotal for developing point-of-need biosensors. Here, we attempt to bridge these domains by providing a framework that connects output(s) of molecular interaction studies with key performance indicators used in the development of point-of-need biosensors. First, we briefly review the governing theory for protein-ligand interactions, and we then summarize the approach for real-time kinetic quantification using various techniques. The 2020 PRISMA guideline was used for all governing theory reviews and meta-analyses. Using the information from the meta-analysis, we introduce an experimental framework for connecting outcomes from BLI experiments (KD, kon, koff) with electrochemical (capacitive) biosensor design. As a first step in the development of a larger framework, we specifically focus on mapping BLI outcomes to five biosensor key performance indicators (sensitivity, selectivity, response time, hysteresis, operating range). The applicability of our framework was demonstrated in a study of case based on published literature related to SARS-CoV-2 spike protein to show the development of a capacitive biosensor based on truncated angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) as the receptor. The case study focuses on non-specific binding and selectivity as research goals.

PCR testing is generally definitive but expensive, although it is highly sensitive and accurate. Biosensor-based monitoring could be a low-cost, accurate, and non-invasive approach to improve testing capacity. We develop a capacitive hACE2 biosensor for intact SARS-CoV-2 detection in saliva. Laser-induced graphene (LIG) electrodes were modified with platinum nanoparticles. The quality control of LIG electrodes was performed using cyclic voltammetry. Truncated hACE2 was used as a biorecognition element and attached to the electrode surface by streptavidin-biotin coupling. Biolayer interferometry was used for qualitative interaction screening of hACE2 with UV-attenuated virions. Electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) was used for signal transduction. Truncated hACE2 binds wild-type SARS-CoV-2 and its variants with greater avidity than human coronavirus (common cold virus). The limit of detection (LoD) is estimated to be 2,960 copies/ml. The detection process usually takes less than 30 min. The strength of these features makes the hACE2 biosensor a potentially low-cost approach for screening SARS-CoV-2 in non-clinical settings with high demand for rapid testing (for example, schools and airports).",AA029328,Frontiers in sensors,2022

Here, we report a mechanically triggered hybridization chain reaction (mechano-HCR) that allows chemical amplification of mechanical events. The amplification is triggered when a cell receptor mechanically denatures a duplex revealing a cryptic initiator to activate the HCR reaction in situ. Importantly, mechano-HCR enables direct readout of pN forces using a plate reader. We leverage this capability and measured mechano-IC50 for aspirin, Y-27632, and eptifibatide. Given that cell mechanical phenotypes are of clinical importance, mechano-HCR may offer a convenient route for drug discovery, personalized medicine, and disease diagnosis.",AA029345,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2021

Recently, aptamers have garnered increased interest due to their unique properties, including inexpensive production, simple chemical modification, and long-term stability.

In this review, we discuss the aptamer discovery process as well as aptamer applications to biosensors and separations. In the discovery section, we describe the major steps of the library selection process for aptamers, called systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX). We highlight common approaches and emerging strategies in SELEX, from starting library selection to aptamer-target binding characterization. In the applications section, we first evaluate recently developed aptamer biosensors for SARS-CoV-2 virus detection, including electrochemical aptamer-based sensors and lateral flow assays. Then we discuss aptamer-based separations for partitioning different molecules or cell types, especially for purifying T cell subsets for therapeutic applications.

While these devices have played a significant role in alleviating the burden on the public healthcare system, their specificity and sensitivity fall short compared with molecular tests. In this study, we endeavor to address both limitations through the utilization of DNA nanotechnology in LFA format, wherein we substitute the target-specific antibody with designer DNA nanostructure-based molecular probes for recognizing the SARS-CoV-2 virus via multivalent, pattern-matching interactions. We meticulously designed a Net-shaped DNA nanostructure and strategically arranged trimeric clusters of aptamers that specifically recognize the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. This approach has proven instrumental in bolstering virus-binding affinity on the LFAs. Our findings indicate high LFA sensitivity, enabling the detection of viral loads ranging from 103 to 108 viral copies/mL. This notable sensitivity is maintained across various SARS-CoV-2 viral strains, obviating the need for intricate sample preparation protocols. The significance of this heightened sensitivity lies in the crucial role played by the designer DNA nanostructure, which facilitates the detection of extremely low levels of viral loads.

Central to our ability to successfully tackle these diseases is the need to quickly detect the causative virus and neutralize it efficiently. Here we present the rational design of DNA nanostructures to inhibit dengue virus infection. The designer DNA nanostructure (DDN) can bind to complementary epitopes on antigens dispersed across the surface of a viral particle. Since these antigens are arranged in a defined geometric pattern that is unique to each virus, the structure of the DDN is designed to mirror the spatial arrangement of antigens on the viral particle, providing very high viral binding avidity. We describe how available structural data can be used to identify unique spatial patterns of antigens on the surface of a viral particle. We then present a procedure for synthesizing DDNs using a combination of in silico design principles, self-assembly, and characterization using gel electrophoresis, atomic force microscopy and surface plasmon resonance spectroscopy. Finally, we evaluate the efficacy of a DDN in inhibiting dengue virus infection via plaque-forming assays. We expect this protocol to take 2-3 d to complete virus antigen pattern identification from existing cryogenic electron microscopy data, ~2 weeks for DDN design, synthesis, and virus binding characterization, and ~2 weeks for DDN cytotoxicity and antiviral efficacy assays.",AA029348,Nature protocols,2022

The lengthy time delays required to obtain test results, the high cost of gold-standard PCR tests, and poor sensitivity of rapid point-of-care tests contributed directly to society's inability to efficiently identify COVID-19-positive individuals for quarantine, which in turn continues to impact return to normal activities throughout the economy. Over the past year, enormous resources have been invested to develop more effective rapid tests and laboratory tests with greater throughput, yet the vast majority of engineering and chemistry approaches are merely incremental improvements to existing methods for nucleic acid amplification, lateral flow test strips, and enzymatic amplification assays for protein-based biomarkers. Meanwhile, widespread commercial availability of new test kits continues to be hampered by the cost and time required to develop single-use disposable microfluidic plastic cartridges manufactured by injection molding. Through development of novel technologies for sensitive, selective, rapid, and robust viral detection and more efficient approaches for scalable manufacturing of microfluidic devices, we can be much better prepared for future management of infectious pathogen outbreaks. Here, we describe how photonic metamaterials, graphene nanomaterials, designer DNA nanostructures, and polymers amenable to scalable additive manufacturing are being applied towards overcoming the fundamental limitations of currently dominant COVID-19 diagnostic approaches.

However, this can contribute to excess sodium intake and a poor diet. Capsaicin may help increase salt taste intensity and eating enjoyment in this population, but this has not been studied. The purpose of this study was to determine 1) whether salt intake in those with smell loss differs from population averages, 2) whether capsaicin increases flavor and salt taste intensity, and 3) if adding spice to foods increases food liking in individuals with smell loss. Participants 18-65 years old with confirmed partial or total smell loss for at least 12 weeks completed two sets of replicate test sessions (four total). In two sessions participants rated overall flavor intensity, taste qualities' intensities, spicy intensity, and liking for model tomato soups with low or regular sodium content and three levels of capsaicin (none, low, or moderate). In the other two sessions, participants rated the same sensory attributes for model food samples with three levels of added spice (none, low, or moderate). 24-hour urine samples were also collected to determine sodium intake. Results indicate that although sodium intake is higher than recommended in those with smell loss (2893 ± 258 mg/day), they do not consume more sodium than population averages. Adding low and moderate amounts of capsaicin to a model tomato soup increased the intensity of overall flavor and saltiness compared to a model tomato soup without capsaicin. However, the effect of capsaicin on liking differed by food type. In conclusion, the addition of capsaicin can improve flavor, salt taste intensity, and eating enjoyment in people with smell loss.",DC019578,medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2023

We tested whether self-administering the SCENTinel 1.0 test discriminates between individuals with self-reported smell loss and those with average smell ability (normosmic individuals) and provides performance comparable to the validated and standardized NIH Toolbox Odor Identification Test in normosmic individuals. Using Bayesian linear models and prognostic classification algorithms, we compared the SCENTinel 1.0 performance of a group of self-reported anosmic individuals (N = 111, 47 ± 13 years old, F = 71%) and normosmic individuals (N = 154, 47 ± 14 years old, F = 74%) as well as individuals reporting other smell disorders (such as hyposmia or parosmia; N = 42, 55 ± 10 years old, F = 67%). Ninety-four percent of normosmic individuals met our SCENTinel 1.0 accuracy criteria compared with only 10% of anosmic individuals and 64% of individuals with other smell disorders. Overall performance on SCENTinel 1.0 predicted belonging to the normosmic group better than identification or detection alone (vs. anosmic: AUC = 0.95, specificity = 0.94). Odor intensity provided the best single-feature predictor to classify normosmic individuals.

In particular, OMP, a small cytoplasmic protein, marks mature ORNs and is also expressed in the neurons of other nasal chemosensory systems: the vomeronasal organ, the septal organ of Masera, and the Grueneberg ganglion. While its expression pattern was more easily established, OMP's function remained relatively vague. To date, most of the work to understand OMP's role has been done using mice lacking OMP. This mostly phenomenological work has shown that OMP is involved in sharpening the odorant response profile and in quickening odorant response kinetics of ORNs and that it contributes to targeting of ORN axons to the olfactory bulb to refine the glomerular response map. Increasing evidence shows that OMP acts at the early stages of olfactory transduction by modulating the kinetics of cAMP, the second messenger of olfactory transduction. However, how this occurs at a mechanistic level is not understood, and it might also not be the only mechanism underlying all the changes observed in mice lacking OMP.

However, these reports have downplayed or failed to distinguish potential effects on taste, ignored chemesthesis, and generally lacked quantitative measurements. Here, we report the development, implementation, and initial results of a multilingual, international questionnaire to assess self-reported quantity and quality of perception in 3 distinct chemosensory modalities (smell, taste, and chemesthesis) before and during COVID-19. In the first 11 days after questionnaire launch, 4039 participants (2913 women, 1118 men, and 8 others, aged 19-79) reported a COVID-19 diagnosis either via laboratory tests or clinical assessment. Importantly, smell, taste, and chemesthetic function were each significantly reduced compared to their status before the disease. Difference scores (maximum possible change ±100) revealed a mean reduction of smell (-79.7 ± 28.7, mean ± standard deviation), taste (-69.0 ± 32.6), and chemesthetic (-37.3 ± 36.2) function during COVID-19. Qualitative changes in olfactory ability (parosmia and phantosmia) were relatively rare and correlated with smell loss. Importantly, perceived nasal obstruction did not account for smell loss. Furthermore, chemosensory impairments were similar between participants in the laboratory test and clinical assessment groups. These results show that COVID-19-associated chemosensory impairment is not limited to smell but also affects taste and chemesthesis. The multimodal impact of COVID-19 and the lack of perceived nasal obstruction suggest that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus strain 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection may disrupt sensory-neural mechanisms.",DC019578,Chemical senses,2020

Tastes and smells can warn against danger and also contribute to the daily enjoyment of food, friends and family, and our surroundings. Over 12% of the US population is estimated to experience taste and smell (chemosensory) dysfunction. Yet, despite this high prevalence, long-term, effective treatments for these disorders have been largely elusive. Clinical successes in other sensory systems, including hearing and vision, have led to new hope for developments in the treatment of chemosensory disorders. To accelerate cures, we convened the ""Identifying Treatments for Taste and Smell Disorders"" conference, bringing together basic and translational sensory scientists, health care professionals, and patients to identify gaps in our current understanding of chemosensory dysfunction and next steps in a broad-based research strategy. Their suggestions for high-yield next steps were focused in 3 areas: increasing awareness and research capacity (e.g., patient advocacy), developing and enhancing clinical measures of taste and smell, and supporting new avenues of research into cellular and therapeutic approaches (e.g., developing human chemosensory cell lines, stem cells, and gene therapy approaches). These long-term strategies led to specific suggestions for immediate research priorities that focus on expanding our understanding of specific responses of chemosensory cells and developing valuable assays to identify and document cell development, regeneration, and function. Addressing these high-priority areas should accelerate the development of novel and effective treatments for taste and smell disorders.",DC019578,Chemical senses,2020

Loss of taste is possible but rare with these illnesses, and patient reports of 'taste loss' typically arise from a taste / flavor confusion. Thus, initial reports from COVID-19 patients of loss of taste and chemesthesis (i.e., chemical somatosensation like warming or cooling) were met with skepticism until multiple studies confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infections could disrupt these senses. Many studies have been based on self-report or on single time point assessments after acute illness was ended. Here, we describe intensive longitudinal data over 28 days from adults aged 18-45 years recruited in early 2021 (i.e., prior to the Delta and Omicron SARS-CoV-2 waves). These individuals were either COVID-19 positive or close contacts (per U.S. CDC criteria at the time of the study) in the first half of 2021. Upon enrollment, all participants were given nose clips, blinded samples of commercial jellybeans (Sour Cherry and Cinnamon), and scratch-n-sniff odor identification test cards (ScentCheckPro), which they used for daily assessments. In COVID-19 cases who enrolled on or before Day 10 of infection, Gaussian Process Regression showed two distinct measures of function - odor identification and odor intensity - declined relative to controls (exposed individuals who never developed COVID-19). Because enrollment began upon exposure, some participants became ill only after enrollment, which allowed us to capture baseline ratings, onset of loss, and recovery. Data from these four cases and four age- and sex- matched controls were plotted over 28 days to create panel plots. Variables included mean orthonasal intensity of four odors (ScentCheckPro), perceived nasal blockage, oral burn (Cinnamon jellybeans), and sourness and sweetness (Sour Cherry jellybeans). Controls exhibited stable ratings over time. By contrast, COVID-19 cases showed sharp deviations over time. Changes in odor intensity or odor identification were not explained by nasal blockage. No single pattern of taste loss or recovery was apparent, implying different taste qualities might recover at different rates. Oral burn was transiently reduced for some before recovering quickly, suggesting acute loss may be missed in datasets collected only after illness ends. Collectively, intensive daily testing shows orthonasal smell, oral chemesthesis and taste were each altered by acute SARS-CoV-2 infection. This disruption was dyssynchronous for different modalities, with variable loss and recovery rates across both modalities and individuals.",DC019573,Physiology & behavior,2023

Additionally, many commercially available tests are slow and may require a trained administrator, making them impractical for use in situations where time is at a premium or self-administration is required. We tested the performance of the Adaptive Olfactory Measure of Threshold (ArOMa-T)-a novel odor detection threshold test that employs an adaptive Bayesian algorithm paired with a disposable odorant delivery card-in a non-clinical sample of individuals (n = 534) at the 2021 Twins Day Festival in Twinsburg, OH. Participants successfully completed the test in under 3 min with a false alarm rate of 7.5% and a test-retest reliability of 0.61. Odor detection thresholds differed by sex (~3.2-fold lower for females) and age (~8.7-fold lower for the youngest versus the oldest age group), consistent with prior studies. In an exploratory analysis, we failed to observe evidence of detection threshold differences between participants who reported a history of COVID-19 and matched controls who did not. We also found evidence for broad-sense heritability of odor detection thresholds. Together, this study suggests the ArOMa-T can determine odor detection thresholds. Additional validation studies are needed to confirm the value of ArOMa-T in clinical or field settings where rapid and portable assessment of olfactory function is needed.",DC019573,Chemical senses,2022

Although many investigators have described taste responses of rNST neurons, the phenotypes of these cells were unknown. To directly compare the response characteristics of both inhibitory and noninhibitory neurons, we recorded from mice expressing Channelrhodopsin-2 (ChR2) under the control of GAD65, a synthetic enzyme for GABA. We observed that chemosensitive profiles of GABAergic taste neurons (G+TASTE) were similar to non-GABA taste neurons (G-TASTE) but had much lower response rates. We further observed a novel subpopulation of GABA cells located more ventrally in the nucleus that were unresponsive to taste stimulation (G+UNR), suggesting pathways for inhibition initiated by centrifugal sources. This preparation also allowed us to determine how optogenetic activation of the rNST GABA network impacted the taste responses of G-TASTE neurons. Activating rNST inhibitory circuitry suppressed gustatory responses of G-TASTE neurons across all qualities and chemosensitive types of neurons. Although the tuning curves of identified G-TASTE were modestly sharpened, the overall shape of response profiles and the ensemble pattern remained highly stable. These neurophysiological effects were consistent with the behavioral consequences of activating GAD65-expressing inhibitory neurons using DREADDs. In a brief-access licking task, concentration-response curves to both palatable (sucrose, maltrin) and unpalatable (quinine) stimuli were shifted to the right when GABA neurons were activated. Thus, the rNST GABAergic network is poised to modulate taste intensity across the qualitative and hedonic spectrum.",DC016112,eNeuro,2022

The potassium current IA is one potential source of modulation. In the caudal NST, projection neurons with IA show lower fidelity to afferent stimulation compared to cells without. We explored the role of an A-type K+ current (IA) in modulating the response to afferent stimulation and GABA-mediated inhibition in the rNST using whole cell patch clamp recording in transgenic mice that expressed channelrhodopsin (ChR2 H134R) in GABAergic neurons. The presence of IA was determined in current clamp and the response to electrical stimulation of afferent fibers in the solitary tract was assessed before and after treatment with the specific Kv4 channel blocker AmmTX3. Blocking IA significantly increased the response to afferent stimulation by 53%. Using dynamic clamp to create a synthetic IA conductance, we demonstrated a significant 14% decrease in responsiveness to afferent stimulation in cells lacking IA. Because IA reduced excitability and is hyperpolarization-sensitive, we examined whether IA contributed to the inhibition resulting from optogenetic release of GABA. Although blocking IA decreased the percent suppression induced by GABA, this effect was attributable to the increased responsiveness resulting from AmmTX3, not to a change in the absolute magnitude of suppression. We conclude that rNST responses to afferent input are regulated independently by IA and GABA.",DC016112,Neuroscience,2022

In addition to synaptic interactions, central processing is also influenced by the ion channel composition of individual neurons. For example, voltage-gated K+ channels such as outward K+ current (IA) can modify the integrative properties of neurons. IA currents are prevalent in rNST projection cells but are also found to a lesser extent in GABAergic interneurons. However, characterization of the kinetic properties of IA, the molecular basis of these currents, as well as the consequences of IA on spiking properties of identified rNST cells is lacking. Here, we show that IA in rNST GABAergic (G+) and non-GABAergic (G-) neurons share a common molecular basis. In both cell types, there was a reduction in IA following treatment with the specific Kv4 channel blocker AmmTx3. However, the kinetics of activation and inactivation of IA in the two cell types were different with G- neurons having significantly more negative half-maximal activation and inactivation values. Likewise, under current clamp, G- cells had significantly longer delays to spike initiation in response to a depolarizing stimulus preceded by a hyperpolarizing prepulse. Computational modeling and dynamic clamp suggest that differences in the activation half-maximum may account for the differences in delay. We further observed evidence for a window current under both voltage clamp and current clamp protocols. We speculate that the location of Kv4.3 channels on dendrites, together with a window current for IA at rest, serves to regulate excitatory afferent inputs.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Here, we demonstrate that the transient outward K+ current IA occurs in both GABAergic and non-GABAergic neurons via Kv4.3 channels in the rostral (gustatory) solitary nucleus. Although found in both cell types, IA is more prevalent in non-GABAergic cells; a larger conductance at more negative potentials leads to a greater impact on spike initiation compared with GABAergic neurons. An IA window current further suggests that IA can regulate excitatory afferent input to the nucleus.",DC016112,Journal of neurophysiology,2020

Genetic manipulations that delete or inactivate the translin/trax microRNA-degrading enzyme confer protection against aortic stiffness induced by chronic ingestion of high-salt water (4%NaCl in drinking water for 3 weeks) or associated with aging. Therefore, there is heightened interest in identifying interventions capable of inhibiting translin/trax RNase activity, as these may have therapeutic efficacy in large-artery stiffness. Methods and Results Activation of neuronal adenosine A2A receptors (A2ARs) triggers dissociation of trax from its C-terminus. As A2ARs are expressed by vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs), we investigated whether stimulation of A2AR on vascular smooth muscle cells promotes the association of translin with trax and, thereby increases translin/trax complex activity. We found that treatment of A7r5 cells with the A2AR agonist CGS21680 leads to increased association of trax with translin. Furthermore, this treatment decreases levels of pre-microRNA-181b, a target of translin/trax, and those of its downstream product, mature microRNA-181b. To check whether A2AR activation might contribute to high-salt water-induced aortic stiffening, we assessed the impact of daily treatment with the selective A2AR antagonist SCH58261 in this paradigm. We found that this treatment blocked aortic stiffening induced by high-salt water. Further, we confirmed that the age-associated decline in aortic pre-microRNA-181b/microRNA-181b levels observed in mice also occurs in humans. Conclusions These findings suggest that further studies are warranted to evaluate whether blockade of A2ARs may have therapeutic potential in treating large-artery stiffness.",TR003780,Journal of the American Heart Association,2023

Abnormalities in skeletal muscle (SM) metabolism have been identified in patients with HF. However, the underlying mechanisms of IR development in SM in HF are poorly understood. Herein, we hypothesize that HF upregulates miR-133b in SM and in turn alters glucose metabolism and the propensity toward IR. Mitochondria isolated from SM of mice with HF induced by transverse aortic constriction (TAC) showed lower respiration and downregulation of muscle-specific components of the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, AMP deaminase 1 (AMPD1), and fumarate compared with those from control animals. RNA-Seq and subsequent qPCR validation confirmed upregulation of SM-specific microRNA (miRNA), miR-133b, in TAC versus sham animals. miR-133b overexpression alone resulted in significantly lower mitochondrial respiration, cellular glucose uptake, and glycolysis along with lower ATP production and cellular energy reserve compared with the scramble (Scr) in C2C12 cells. miR-133b binds to the 3'-untranslated region (UTR) of KLF15, the transcription factor for the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter, GLUT4. Overexpression of miR-133b lowers GLUT4 and lowers pAkt in presence of insulin in C2C12 cells. Finally, lowering miR-133b in primary skeletal myocytes isolated from TAC mice using antagomir-133b reversed the changes in KLF15, GLUT4, and AMPD1 compared with the scramble-transfected myocytes. Taken together, these data demonstrate a role for SM miR-133b in altered glucose metabolism in HF and suggest the therapeutic potential in HF to improve glucose uptake and glycolysis by restoring GLUT4 abundance. The data uncover a novel mechanism for IR and ultimately SM metabolic abnormalities in patients with HF.NEW & NOTEWORTHY Heart failure is associated with systemic insulin resistance and abnormalities in glucose metabolism but the underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. In the skeletal muscle, the major peripheral site of glucose utilization, we observe an increase in miR-133b in heart failure mice, which reduces the insulin-sensitive glucose transporter (GLUT4), glucose uptake, and metabolism in C2C12 and in myocytes. The antagomir for miR-133b restores GLUT4 protein and markers of metabolism in skeletal myocytes from heart failure mice demonstrating that miR-133b is an exciting target for systemic insulin resistance in heart failure and an important player in the cross talk between the heart and the periphery in the heart failure syndrome.",TR003780,American journal of physiology.

Because liver plays a pivotal role during obesity, we hypothesized that miR-181c might contribute to the pathophysiological complications associated with obesity. Therefore, we used miR-181c/d-/- mice to study the role of miR-181c in hepatocyte lipogenesis during diet-induced obesity. The mice were fed a high-fat (HF) diet for 26 weeks, during which indirect calorimetric measurements were made. Quantitative PCR (qPCR) was used to examine the expression of genes involved in lipid synthesis. We found that miR-181c/d-/- mice were not protected against all metabolic consequences of HF exposure. After 26 weeks, the miR-181c/d-/- mice had a significantly higher body fat percentage than did wild-type (WT) mice. Glucose tolerance tests showed hyperinsulinemia and hyperglycemia, indicative of insulin insensitivity in the miR-181c/d-/- mice. miR-181c/d-/- mice fed the HF diet had higher serum and liver triglyceride levels than did WT mice fed the same diet. qPCR data showed that several genes regulated by isocitrate dehydrogenase 1 (IDH1) were more upregulated in miR-181c/d-/- liver than in WT liver. Furthermore, miR-181c delivered in vivo via adeno-associated virus attenuated the lipogenesis by downregulating these same lipid synthesis genes in the liver. In hepatocytes, miR-181c regulates lipid biosynthesis by targeting IDH1. Taken together, the data indicate that overexpression of miR-181c can be beneficial for various lipid metabolism disorders.",TR003780,PloS one,2021

EUCLID employs a diffuse-reflective, adjustable hollow cavity that allows for uniform mixing of light from discrete light sources and modifies the source field distribution to compensate for spatial non-uniformity introduced by optical components in the imaging system. In this study, we characterize the light coupling efficiency of the proposed design and compare the uniformity performance with the conventional method.

Thus, we developed metabolic flux models for human lung fibroblast and pulmonary artery smooth muscle cells proliferating in hypoxia. Unexpectedly, we found that hypoxia decreased glycolysis despite activation of hypoxia-inducible factor 1α (HIF-1α) and increased glycolytic enzyme expression. While HIF-1α activation in normoxia by prolyl hydroxylase (PHD) inhibition did increase glycolysis, hypoxia blocked this effect. Multi-omic profiling revealed distinct molecular responses to hypoxia and PHD inhibition, and suggested a critical role for MYC in modulating HIF-1α responses to hypoxia. Consistent with this hypothesis, MYC knockdown in hypoxia increased glycolysis and MYC over-expression in normoxia decreased glycolysis stimulated by PHD inhibition.

We demonstrate that PIONEER outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods. We further systematically validated PIONEER predictions experimentally through generating 2,395 mutations and testing their impact on 6,754 mutation-interaction pairs, confirming the high quality and validity of PIONEER predictions. We show that disease-associated mutations are enriched in PIONEER-predicted protein-protein interfaces after mapping mutations from ~60,000 germline exomes and ~36,000 somatic genomes. We identify 586 significant protein-protein interactions (PPIs) enriched with PIONEER-predicted interface somatic mutations (termed oncoPPIs) from pan-cancer analysis of ~11,000 tumor whole-exomes across 33 cancer types. We show that PIONEER-predicted oncoPPIs are significantly associated with patient survival and drug responses from both cancer cell lines and patient-derived xenograft mouse models.

These transformative advances place a new focus on possible novel interactions between acquired disease determinants and genetic context to produce complex HCM phenotypes, also offering a measure of caution against overemphasizing monogenics as the principal cause of this disease.

In human pulmonary artery endothelial cells (HPAECs), hypoxia increases neural precursor cell expressed, developmentally downregulated 9 (NEDD9) and induces expression of a prothrombotic NEDD9 peptide (N9P) on the extracellular plasma membrane surface. We hypothesized that the SARS-CoV-2-ARDS pathophenotype involves increased pulmonary endothelial N9P. Paraffin-embedded autopsy lung specimens were acquired from patients with SARS-CoV-2-​​​​​​ARDS (n = 13), ARDS from other causes (n = 10), and organ donor controls (n = 5). Immunofluorescence characterized the expression of N9P, fibrin, and transcription factor 12 (TCF12), a putative binding target of SARS-CoV-2 and known transcriptional regulator of NEDD9. We performed RNA-sequencing on normal HPAECs treated with normoxia or hypoxia (0.2% O2) for 24 h. Immunoprecipitation-liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (IP-LC-MS) profiled protein-protein interactions involving N9P relevant to thrombus stabilization. Hypoxia increased TCF12 messenger RNA significantly compared to normoxia in HPAECs in vitro (+1.19-fold, p = 0.001; false discovery rate = 0.005), and pulmonary endothelial TCF12 expression was increased threefold in SARS-CoV-2-ARDS versus donor control lungs (p < 0.001). Compared to donor controls, pulmonary endothelial N9P-fibrin colocalization was increased in situ in non-SARS-CoV-2-ARDS and SARS-CoV-2-ARDS decedents (3.7 ± 1.2 vs. 10.3 ± 3.2 and 21.8 ± 4.0 arb. units, p < 0.001). However, total pulmonary endothelial N9P was increased significantly only in SARS-CoV-2-ARDS versus donor controls (15 ± 4.2 vs. 6.3 ± 0.9 arb. units, p < 0.001). In HPAEC plasma membrane isolates, IP-LC-MS identified a novel protein-protein interaction between NEDD9 and the β3-subunit of the αvβ3-integrin, which regulates fibrin anchoring to endothelial cells. In conclusion, lethal SARS-CoV-2-ARDS is associated with increased pulmonary endothelial N9P expression and N9P-fibrin colocalization in situ.

Among these are included computational approaches based on omics data for drug repositioning, which have attracted increasing attention. In this work, we developed an adjusted similarity measure implemented by the algorithm SAveRUNNER to reposition drugs for cardiovascular diseases while, at the same time, considering the side effects of drug candidates. We analyzed nine cardiovascular disorders and two side effects. We formulated both disease disorders and side effects as network modules in the human interactome, and considered those drug candidates that are proximal to disease modules but far from side-effects modules as ideal.

Insufficiency of pleiotropic therapeutic approaches delineate the need for inhibitors of dysregulated neutrophil-subset(s) that induce subset-specific apoptosis critical for neutrophil function-shutdown.

In this mini-review, we discuss the noncanonical role of renal intercalated cells (ICs) in pathogen defense and in the initiation of sterile inflammation. This last function has strong implications in the onset of acute kidney injury (AKI), a potentially fatal medical complication that is seen in hospitalized patients. AKI is associated with inflammation, and it is often diagnosed only after the kidneys have suffered significant and often irreversible damage. While examining the regulation of proton secretion by type A ICs (A-ICs), we unexpectedly found high expression of the pro-inflammatory purinergic receptor P2Y14 in these cells. This receptor is located on the apical surface of A-ICs and binds UDP-glucose (UDP-Glc), a danger-associated molecular pattern molecule released from injured cells that is filtered by the glomeruli and is concentrated in the collecting duct lumen. UDP-Glc activates P2Y14 in A-ICs and triggers the production of chemokines that attract pro-inflammatory immune cells into the kidney stroma and aggravate ischemia-induced proximal tubule injury. Inhibition of P2Y14 or deletion of its gene specifically in ICs in a murine model of ischemia-reperfusion injury attenuated these effects. Thus, together with their previously recognized role in pathogen defense, A-ICs are now recognized as sensors and mediators of renal sterile inflammation that participate in the onset of AKI. Blocking the UDP-Glc/P2Y14 pathway in A-ICs provides new insights into the development of novel AKI therapeutics.",HL119145,Nephron,2022

There are 25 selenoproteins in humans, and many of them play essential roles in the protection against oxidative stress. Selenoproteins, such as glutathione peroxidase and thioredoxin reductase, play an important role in the reduction of hydrogen and lipid hydroperoxides, and regulate the redox status of Cys in proteins. Emerging evidence suggests a role for endoplasmic reticulum selenoproteins, such as selenoproteins K, S, and T, in mediating redox homeostasis, protein modifications, and endoplasmic reticulum stress. Selenoprotein P, which functions as a carrier of Se to tissues, also participates in regulating cellular reactive oxygen species. Cellular reactive oxygen species are essential for regulating cell growth and proliferation, protein folding, and normal mitochondrial function, but their excess causes cell damage and mitochondrial dysfunction, and promotes inflammatory responses. Experimental evidence indicates a role for individual selenoproteins in cardiovascular diseases, primarily by modulating the damaging effects of reactive oxygen species. This review examines the roles that selenoproteins play in regulating vascular and cardiac function in health and disease, highlighting their antioxidant and redox actions in these processes.",HL119145,Nutrients,2021

This 'innocent bystander' tissue injury arises in dysregulated hyperinflammatory states from neutrophil functions and neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) intended to kill pathogens, but injure cells instead, causing MOF. Insufficiency of prior therapeutic approaches suggest need to identify dysregulated neutrophil-subset(s) and induce subset-specific apoptosis critical for neutrophil function-shutdown and clearance. We hypothesized that neutrophils expressing the pro-survival dual endothelin-1/signal peptide receptor, DEspR, are apoptosis-resistant just like DEspR+ cancer cells, hence comprise a consequential pathogenic neutrophil-subset in ARDS and COVID19-ARDS. Here, we report correlation of circulating DEspR+CD11b+ activated neutrophils (DESpR+actNs) and NETosing-neutrophils with severity in ARDS and in COVID19-ARDS, increased DEspR+ neutrophils and monocytes in post-mortem ARDS-patient lung sections, and neutrophil DEspR/ET1 receptor/ligand autocrine loops in severe COVID19. Unlike DEspR[-] neutrophils, ARDS patient DEspR+actNs exhibit apoptosis-resistance, which decreased upon ex vivo treatment with humanized anti-DEspR-IgG4S228P antibody, hu6g8. Ex vivo live-cell imaging of non-human primate DEspR+actNs showed hu6g8 target-engagement, internalization, and induction of apoptosis.

However, efficient translation of CRISPR-diagnostic technologies to field application is still hampered by dependence on target amplification and by reliance on fluorescence-based results readout. Herein, an amplification-free CRISPR/Cas12a-based diagnostic technology for SARS-CoV-2 RNA detection is presented using a smartphone camera for results readout. This method, termed Cellphone-based amplification-free system with CRISPR/CAS-dependent enzymatic (CASCADE) assay, relies on mobile phone imaging of a catalase-generated gas bubble signal within a microfluidic channel and does not require any external hardware optical attachments. Upon specific detection of a SARS-CoV-2 reverse-transcribed DNA/RNA heteroduplex target (orf1ab) by the ribonucleoprotein complex, the transcleavage collateral activity of the Cas12a protein on a Catalase:ssDNA probe triggers the bubble signal on the system. High analytical sensitivity in signal detection without previous target amplification (down to 50 copies µL-1) is observed in spiked samples, in ≈71 min from sample input to results readout. With the aid of a smartphone vision tool, high accuracy (AUC = 1.0; CI: 0.715 - 1.00) is achieved when the CASCADE system is tested with nasopharyngeal swab samples of PCR-positive COVID-19 patients.",HL119145,Advanced materials technologies,2021

Peak serum troponin I levels during sepsis were grouped as normal (⩽0.04 ng/ml) or tertiles of abnormal (>0.04 to ⩽0.09 ng/ml, >0.09 to ⩽0.42 ng/ml, or >0.42 ng/ml). Multivariable adjusted cause-specific Cox proportional hazards models with death as a competing risk were used to assess associations between peak troponin I levels and a composite cardiovascular outcome (atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, atrial fibrillation, and heart failure) in the year following sepsis. Models were adjusted for presepsis and intrasepsis factors considered potential confounders.Measurements and Main Results: Among 14,046 eligible adults with troponin I measured, 2,012 (14.3%) experienced the composite cardiovascular outcome, including 832 (10.9%) patients with normal troponin levels, as compared with 370 (17.3%), 376 (17.6%), and 434 (20.3%) patients within each sequential abnormal troponin tertile, respectively (P < 0.001). Patients within the elevated troponin tertiles had increased risks of adverse cardiovascular events (adjusted hazard ratio [aHR]troponin0.04-0.09 = 1.37; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.20-1.55; aHRtroponin0.09-0.42 = 1.44; 95% CI, 1.27-1.63; and aHRtroponin>0.42 = 1.77; 95% CI, 1.56-2.00).Conclusions: Among patients without preexisting cardiovascular disease, troponin elevation during sepsis identified patients at increased risk for postsepsis cardiovascular complications.

To test the predictions, we used as ground truth 918 drugs experimentally screened in VeroE6 cells, as well as the list of drugs in clinical trials that capture the medical community's assessment of drugs with potential COVID-19 efficacy. We find that no single predictive algorithm offers consistently reliable outcomes across all datasets and metrics. This outcome prompted us to develop a multimodal technology that fuses the predictions of all algorithms, finding that a consensus among the different predictive methods consistently exceeds the performance of the best individual pipelines. We screened in human cells the top-ranked drugs, obtaining a 62% success rate, in contrast to the 0.8% hit rate of nonguided screenings. Of the six drugs that reduced viral infection, four could be directly repurposed to treat COVID-19, proposing novel treatments for COVID-19.

Indeed, a principal goal in PAH today is an early diagnosis for prompt initiation of treatment to achieve a minimal symptom burden; optimize the patient's biochemical, hemodynamic, and functional profile; and limit adverse events. To accomplish this end, clinicians must be familiar with novel risk factors and the revised hemodynamic definition for PAH. Fresh insights into the role of developmental biology (i.e., perinatal health) may also be useful for predicting incident PAH in early adulthood.

We find that the protein targets of polyphenols cluster in specific neighbourhoods of the human interactome, whose network proximity to disease proteins is predictive of the molecule's known therapeutic effects. The methodology recovers known associations, such as the effect of epigallocatechin-3-O-gallate on type 2 diabetes, and predicts that rosmarinic acid has a direct impact on platelet function, representing a novel mechanism through which it could affect cardiovascular health.

Objectives: To identify a hypoxia-sensitive, modifiable mediator of platelet-pulmonary artery endothelial cell adhesion and thrombotic remodeling. Methods: Network medicine was used to profile protein-protein interactions in hypoxia-treated human pulmonary artery endothelial cells. Data from liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry and microscale thermophoresis informed the development of a novel antibody (Ab) to inhibit platelet-endothelial adhesion, which was tested in cells from patients with chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH) and three animal models in vivo. Measurements and Main Results: The protein NEDD9 was identified in the hypoxia thrombosome network in silico. Compared with normoxia, hypoxia (0.2% O2) for 24 hours increased HIF-1α (hypoxia-inducible factor-1α)-dependent NEDD9 upregulation in vitro. Increased NEDD9 was localized to the plasma-membrane surface of cells from control donors and patients with CTEPH. In endarterectomy specimens, NEDD9 colocalized with the platelet surface adhesion molecule P-selectin. Our custom-made anti-NEDD9 Ab targeted the NEDD9-P-selectin interaction and inhibited the adhesion of activated platelets to pulmonary artery endothelial cells from control donors in vitro and from patients with CTEPH ex vivo. Compared with control mice, platelet-pulmonary endothelial aggregates and pulmonary hypertension induced by ADP were decreased in NEDD9-/- mice or wild-type mice treated with the anti-NEDD9 Ab, which also decreased chronic pulmonary thromboembolic remodeling in vivo. Conclusions: The NEDD9-P-selectin protein-protein interaction is a modifiable target with which to inhibit platelet-pulmonary endothelial adhesion and thromboembolic vascular remodeling, with potential therapeutic implications for patients with disorders of increased hypoxia signaling pathways, including CTEPH.",HL119145,American journal of respiratory and critical care medicine,2021

We first apply the SWItch Miner (SWIM) methodology, which predicts important (switch) genes within the co-expression network that regulate disease state transitions, then map them to the human protein-protein interaction network (PPI, or interactome) to predict novel disease-disease relationships (i.e., a SWIM-informed diseasome). Although the relevance of switch genes to an observed phenotype has been recently assessed, their performance at the system or network level constitutes a new, potentially fascinating territory yet to be explored. Quantifying the interplay between switch genes and human diseases in the interactome network, we found that switch genes associated with specific disorders are closer to each other than to other nodes in the network, and tend to form localized connected subnetworks. These subnetworks overlap between similar diseases and are situated in different neighborhoods for pathologically distinct phenotypes, consistent with the well-known topological proximity property of disease genes. These findings allow us to demonstrate how SWIM-based correlation network analysis can serve as a useful tool for efficient screening of potentially new disease gene associations. When integrated with an interactome-based network analysis, it not only identifies novel candidate disease genes, but also may offer testable hypotheses by which to elucidate the molecular underpinnings of human disease and reveal commonalities between seemingly unrelated diseases.",HL119145,NPJ systems biology and applications,2021

Here, we show that these critical parameters can be effectively manipulated using hyperbarically-loaded polymeric microcapsules (PMC). PMCs are micron-sized particles with hollow cores and polymeric shells. We show that oxygen delivery through PMCs is dependent on its permeability through the polymeric shell, the shell thickness, and the pressure gradient across the shell.

Disease progression is due in part to dysregulation of VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) signaling in the lungs and increased lung-cell apoptosis. Here we asked whether PR1P (Prominin-1-derived peptide), a novel short peptide we designed that increases VEGF binding to endothelial cells, could be used to improve outcome in in vitro and in vivo models of emphysema. We used computer simulation and in vitro and in vivo studies to show that PR1P upregulated endogenous VEGF receptor-2 signaling by binding VEGF and preventing its proteolytic degradation. In so doing, PR1P mitigated toxin-induced lung-cell apoptosis, including from cigarette-smoke extract in vitro and from LPS in vivo in mice. Remarkably, inhaled PR1P led to significantly increased VEGF concentrations in murine lungs within 30 minutes that remained greater than twofold above that of control animals 24 hours later. Finally, inhaled PR1P reduced acute lung injury in 4- and 21-day elastase-induced murine emphysema models.

In the past decade, network medicine has developed and validated multiple predictive algorithms for drug repurposing, exploiting the sub-cellular network-based relationship between a drug's targets and disease genes. Here, we deployed algorithms relying on artificial intelligence, network diffusion, and network proximity, tasking each of them to rank 6,340 drugs for their expected efficacy against SARS-CoV-2. To test the predictions, we used as ground truth 918 drugs that had been experimentally screened in VeroE6 cells, and the list of drugs under clinical trial, that capture the medical community's assessment of drugs with potential COVID-19 efficacy. We find that while most algorithms offer predictive power for these ground truth data, no single method offers consistently reliable outcomes across all datasets and metrics. This prompted us to develop a multimodal approach that fuses the predictions of all algorithms, showing that a consensus among the different predictive methods consistently exceeds the performance of the best individual pipelines. We find that 76 of the 77 drugs that successfully reduced viral infection do not bind the proteins targeted by SARS-CoV-2, indicating that these drugs rely on network-based actions that cannot be identified using docking-based strategies.

A common pitfall when utilizing AuNPs is their tendency to aggregate, especially when their surface is functionalized with ligands of low molecular weight (no steric repulsion) or ligands of neutral charge (no electrostatic repulsion). For biomedical applications, AuNPs that are colloidally stable are desirable because they have a high surface area and thus reactivity, resist sedimentation, and exhibit uniform optical properties. Here, we engineer the surface of AuNPs so that they remain stable when decorated with coiled-coil (CC) peptides while preserving the native polypeptide properties. We achieve this by using a neutral, mixed ligand layer composed of lipoic acid poly(ethylene glycol) and lipoic acid poly(ethylene glycol) maleimide to attach the CCs. Tuning the surface fraction of each component within the mixed ligand layer also allowed us to control the degree of AuNP labeling with CCs. We demonstrate the dynamic surface properties of these CC-AuNPs by performing a place-exchange reaction and their utility by designing an energy-transfer-based caspase-3 sensor. Overall, this study optimizes the surface chemistry of AuNPs to quantitatively present functional biomolecules while maintaining colloid stability.",DE031114,The journal of physical chemistry. B,2023

Here, we propose a combination of a tunable peptide substrate and gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) to colorimetrically detect the Southampton norovirus 3C-like protease (SV3CP), a key protease in viral replication. Careful design of the substrate employs a zwitterionic peptide with opposite charged moieties on the C- and N- termini to induce a rapid color change visible to the naked eye; thus, this color change is indicative of SV3CP activity. This work expands on existing zwitterionic peptide strategies for protease detection by systematically evaluating the effects of lysine and arginine on nanoparticle charge screening. We also determine a limit of detection for SV3CP of 28.0 nM with comparable results in external breath condensate, urine, and fecal matter for 100 nM of SV3CP.

The LSPR of nanoparticles can shift in response to changes in the local dielectric environment and produce a color change. This color change can be observed by the naked eye due to the exceptionally large extinction coefficients (108-1011 M-1 cm-1) of plasmonic nanoparticles. Herein, we investigate the optical shifts (i.e., color change) of three unique gold-silver core-shell nanoparticle structures in response to changes in their dielectric environment upon nanoparticle aggregation. Aggregation is induced by a cysteine-containing peptide that has a sulfhydryl near its N and C termini, which crosslinks nanoparticles. Furthermore, we demonstrate that adding proline spacers between the cysteines impacts the degree of aggregation and, ultimately, the color response. Using this information, we construct a colorimetric enzyme assay, where the signal produced from nanoparticle aggregation is modulated by proteolysis. The degree of aggregation and the resulting optical shift can be correlated with enzyme concentration with high linearity (R2 = 0.998).

Our results underscore the importance of the polyproline module, which enables the SARS-CoV-2 main protease (Mpro) to recognize the peptidic ligand on nanosurfaces for subsequent plasmonic coupling via Coulombic interactions.

The AuNPs were first aggregated by attractive forces between the citrate-capped surface and the arginine side chains. We found that the HS-PEG thiol group has a higher affinity for the AuNP surface, thus leading to redispersion and colloidal stability. In turn, there was a robust and obvious color change due to on/off plasmonic coupling. The assemblies' dissociation was directly related to the HS-PEG structural properties such as their size or charge. As an example, HS-PEGs with a molecular weight below 1 kDa could dissociate 100% of the assemblies and restore the exact optical properties of the initial AuNP suspension (prior to the assembly). Surprisingly, the dissociation capacity of HS-PEGs was not affected by the composition of the operating medium and could be performed in complex matrices such as plasma, saliva, bile, urine, cell lysates, or even seawater. The high affinity of thiols for the gold surface encompasses by far the one of endogenous molecules and is thus favored. Moreover, starting with AuNPs already aggregated ensured the absence of a background signal as the dissociation of the assemblies was far from spontaneous. Remarkably, it was possible to dry the AuNP assemblies and solubilize them back with HS-PEGs, improving the colorimetric signal generation. We used this system for protease sensing in biological fluids. Trypsin was chosen as the model enzyme, and highly positively charged peptides were conjugated to HS-PEG molecules as cleavage substrates. The increase of positive charge of the HS-PEG-peptide conjugate quenched the dissociation capacity of the HS-PEG molecules, which could only be restored by the proteolytic cleavage. Picomolar limit of detection was obtained as well as the detection in saliva or urine.",DE031114,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2022

Engineered sensitivity to protease activity is particularly desirable because proteases are critical biomarkers in cancer, infectious disease, inflammatory disorders, and so forth. Herein, we developed and characterized a set of peptide-linked cyanine conjugates for dual-modal detection of protease activity via photoacoustic (PA) and fluorescence imaging. The peptide-dye conjugates were designed to undergo contact quenching via intramolecular dimerization and contained n dyes (n = 2, 3, or 4) with n - 1 cleavable peptide substrates. The absorption peaks of the conjugates were blue-shifted 50 nm relative to the free dye and had quenched fluorescence. This effect was sensitive to solvent polarity and could be reversed by solvent switching from water to dimethyl sulfoxide. Employing trypsin as a model protease, we observed a 2.5-fold recovery of the peak absorbance, 330-4600-fold fluorescent enhancement, and picomolar detection limits following proteolysis. The dimer probe was further characterized for PA activation. Proteolysis released single dye-peptide fragments that produced a 5-fold PA enhancement through the increased absorption at 680 nm with nanomolar sensitivity to trypsin. The peptide substrate could also be tuned for protease selectivity; as a proof-of-concept, we detected the main protease (Mpro) associated with the viral replication in SARS-CoV-2 infection. Last, the activated probe was imaged subcutaneously in mice and signal was linearly correlated to the cleaved probe.

Existing approaches to estimating the time origins are commonly built on extrapolating a parametric longitudinal model, which rely on rigid assumptions that can lead to biased inferences. In this paper, we introduce a flexible semiparametric curve registration model. It assumes the longitudinal trajectories follow a flexible common shape function with person-specific disease progression pattern characterized by a random curve registration function, which is further used to model the unknown time origin as a random start time. This random time is used as a link to jointly model the longitudinal and survival data where the unknown time origins are integrated out in the joint likelihood function, which facilitates unbiased and consistent estimation. Since the disease progression pattern naturally predicts time-to-event, we further propose a new functional survival model using the registration function as a predictor of the time-to-event. The asymptotic consistency and semiparametric efficiency of the proposed models are proved. Simulation studies and two real data applications demonstrate the effectiveness of this new approach.",DK130067,Journal of the American Statistical Association,2023

Although studies have found that central venous catheter (CVC) is often associated with poor outcomes and switching to arteriovenous fistula (AVF) and arteriovenous grafts (AVG) is beneficial, it has not been fully elucidated how the effect of switching of access on outcomes changes over time and whether the effect depends on switching time. In this paper we propose to relate the observed survival time for patients without access change and the counterfactual time for patients with access change using an AFT model with time-varying effects. The flexibility of AFT model allows us to account for baseline effect and the prognostic effect from covariates at access change while estimating the effect of access change. The effect of access change overtime is modeled nonparametrically using a cubic spline function. Simulation studies show excellent performance. Our methods are applied to investigate the effect of vascular access change over time in dialysis patients. It is concluded that the benefit of switching from CVC to AVG depends on the time of switching, the sooner the better.",DK130067,Communications in statistics: theory and methods,2023

The proposed model reduces to some of the existing models when selected components in the SS ANOVA decomposition are eliminated. We propose new estimation procedures under either L 1 or L 2 penalty and show that the combination of the SS ANOVA decomposition and L 1 penalty provides powerful tools for model selection and diagnostics. We establish consistency and convergence rates for estimates of the regression function and each component in its decomposition under both the L 1 and L 2 penalties.

We decompose the Brier score into two components, the mean squares between the estimated and true underlying binary probabilities, and the variance of the binary outcome that is not reflective of the model performance. We then propose to modify the Brier score by removing the variance of the binary outcome, estimated via a general sliding window approach. We show that the new proposed measure is more sensitive for comparing different models through simulation.

This innovative approach can greatly enhance the delivery and release of miR-133a zippers, increasing the expression of thermogenic genes and mitochondrial biogenesis. he miR-133a zipper NP is utilized for the delivery of miRNA zipper-blocking miR-133a, an endogenous inhibitor of Prdm16 expression, to enhance the thermogenic activity of adipocytes by modulating their transcriptional program. Inhibition of miR-133a through the miR-133a zipper NP leads to more significant upregulation of thermogenic gene expression (Prdm16 and Ucp1) than with the free miR-133a zipper strand. Furthermore, miR-133a zipper NPs increase the number of mitochondria and induce heat production, reducing the size of 3D adipose spheroids.

However, the inflammatory microenvironment of the atherosclerotic plaque frequently affects the biology of both apoptotic cells and resident phagocytes, rendering efferocytosis dysfunctional. To overcome this problem, a chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) macrophage that can target and engulf phagocytosis-resistant apoptotic cells expressing CD47 is developed. In both normal and inflammatory circumstances, CAR macrophages exhibit activity equivalent to antibody blockage. The surface of CAR macrophages is modified with reactive oxygen species (ROS)-responsive therapeutic nanoparticles targeting the liver X receptor pathway to improve their cell effector activities. The combination of CAR and nanoparticle engineering activated lipid efflux pumps enhances cell debris clearance and reduces inflammation. It is further suggested that the undifferentiated CAR-Ms can transmigrate within a mico-fabricated vessel system. It is also shown that our CAR macrophage can act as a chimeric switch receptor (CSR) to withstand the immunosuppressive inflammatory environment.

To investigate this potential, HER2 antigen was expressed in HEK293 F cells, purified, and used to immunize llama. Using phage display, anti-HER2 VHHs with high affinity and specificity were isolated, sequenced, and constructed with a Histag and c-Myc tag.

To effectively control this complex inflammatory signaling, it developed an all-in-one nanoscaffold-based 3D porous hybrid protein (3D-PHP) self-therapeutic strategy for treating intervertebral disc (IVD) degeneration. The 3D-PHP nanoscaffold is synthesized by introducing a novel nanomaterial-templated protein assembly (NTPA) strategy. 3D-PHP nanoscaffolds that avoid covalent modification of proteins demonstrate inflammatory stimuli-responsive drug release, disc-mimetic stiffness, and excellent biodegradability. Enzyme-like 2D nanosheets incorporated into nanoscaffolds further enabled robust scavenging of ROS and cf-NAs, reducing inflammation and enhancing the survival of disc cells under inflammatory stress in vitro. Implantation of 3D-PHP nanoscaffolds loaded with bromodomain extraterminal inhibitor (BETi) into a rat nucleotomy disc injury model effectively suppressed inflammation in vivo, thus promoting restoration of the extracellular matrix (ECM). The resulting regeneration of disc tissue facilitated long-term pain reduction.

Studies show that the spike proteins of SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 bind to human angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (hACE2, a well-recognized, functional receptor for SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2) to mediate viral entry. Several hACE2 transgenic (hACE2Tg) mouse models are being widely used, which are clearly invaluable. However, the hACE2Tg mouse model cannot fully explain: 1) low expression of ACE2 observed in human lung and heart, but lung or heart failure occurs frequently in severe COVID-19 patients; 2) low expression of ACE2 on immune cells, but lymphocytopenia occurs frequently in COVID-19 patients; and 3) hACE2Tg mice do not mimic the natural course of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans. Moreover, one of most outstanding features of coronavirus infection is the diversity of receptor usage, which includes the newly proposed human CD147 (hCD147) as a possible co-receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry. It is still debatable whether CD147 can serve as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV-2 infection or entry. Results: Here we successfully generated a hCD147 knock-in mouse model (hCD147KI) in the NOD- scid IL2Rgamma null (NSG) background. In this hCD147KI-NSG mouse model, the hCD147 genetic sequence was placed downstream of the endogenous mouse promoter for mouse CD147 (mCD147), which creates an in vivo model that may better recapitulate physiological expression of hCD147 proteins at the molecular level compared to the existing and well-studied K18-hACE2-B6 (JAX) model. In addition, the hCD147KI-NSG mouse model allows further study of SARS-CoV-2 in the immunodeficiency condition which may assist our understanding of this virus in the context of high-risk populations in immunosuppressed states. Our data show 1) the human CD147 protein is expressed in various organs (including bronchiolar epithelial cells) in hCD147KI-NSG mice by immunohistochemical staining and flow cytometry; 2) hCD147KI-NSG mice are marginally sensitive to SARS-CoV-2 infection compared to WT-NSG littermates characterized by increased viral copies by qRT-PCR and moderate body weight decline compared to baseline; 3) a significant increase in leukocytes in the lungs of hCD147KI-NSG mice, compared to infected WT-NSG mice. Conclusions: hCD147KI-NSG mice are more sensitive to COVID-19 infection compared to WT-NSG mice. The hCD147KI-NSG mouse model can serve as an additional animal model for further interrogation whether CD147 serve as an independent functional receptor or accessory receptor for SARS-CoV-2 entry and immune responses.",HL150852,Research square,2022

Machine learning (ML) is an artificial intelligence (AI) tool that automatically processes huge amounts of image data. Immunotherapies have revolutionized the treatment of blood cancer. Specifically, one such therapy involves engineering immune cells to express chimeric antigen receptors (CAR), which combine tumor antigen specificity with immune cell activation in a single receptor. To improve their efficacy and expand their applicability to solid tumors, scientists optimize different CARs with different modifications. However, predicting and ranking the efficacy of different ""off-the-shelf"" immune products (e.g., CAR or Bispecific T-cell Engager [BiTE]) and selection of clinical responders are challenging in clinical practice. Meanwhile, identifying the optimal CAR construct for a researcher to further develop a potential clinical application is limited by the current, time-consuming, costly, and labor-intensive conventional tools used to evaluate efficacy. Particularly, more than 30 years of immunological synapse (IS) research data demonstrate that T cell efficacy is not only controlled by the specificity and avidity of the tumor antigen and T cell interaction, but also it depends on a collective process, involving multiple adhesion and regulatory molecules, as well as tumor microenvironment, spatially and temporally organized at the IS formed by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL) and natural killer (NK) cells. The optimal function of cytotoxic lymphocytes (including CTL and NK) depends on IS quality. Recognizing the inadequacy of conventional tools and the importance of IS in immune cell functions, we investigate a new strategy for assessing CAR-T efficacy by quantifying CAR IS quality using the glass-support planar lipid bilayer system combined with ML-based data analysis. Previous studies in our group show that CAR-T IS quality correlates with antitumor activities in vitro and in vivo. However, current manually quantified IS quality data analysis is time-consuming and labor-intensive with low accuracy, reproducibility, and repeatability. In this study, we develop a novel ML-based method to quantify thousands of CAR cell IS images with enhanced accuracy and speed. Specifically, we used artificial neural networks (ANN) to incorporate object detection into segmentation. The proposed ANN model extracts the most useful information to differentiate different IS datasets. The network output is flexible and produces bounding boxes, instance segmentation, contour outlines (borders), intensities of the borders, and segmentations without borders. Based on requirements, one or a combination of this information is used in statistical analysis. The ML-based automated algorithm quantified CAR-T IS data correlates with the clinical responder and non-responder treated with Kappa-CAR-T cells directly from patients. The results suggest that CAR cell IS quality can be used as a potential composite biomarker and correlates with antitumor activities in patients, which is sufficiently discriminative to further test the CAR IS quality as a clinical biomarker to predict response to CAR immunotherapy in cancer. For translational research, the method developed here can also provide guidelines for designing and optimizing numerous CAR constructs for potential clinical development.

Bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) ligand BMP4 is being examined as a potential therapeutic for GBMs because it induces differentiation of cancer stem cells (CSCs) to an astrocyte phenotype. ID1 is reported to promote self-renewal and inhibit CSC differentiation. In most cancers, ID1 is transcriptionally upregulated by BMP4 promoting invasion and stemness. This conflicting data bring into question whether BMP signaling is growth suppressive or growth promoting in GBMs. We utilized BMP inhibitors DMH1, JL5, and Ym155 to examine the role of BMP signaling on the growth of GBMs. DMH1 targets BMP type 1 receptors whereas JL5 inhibits both the type 1 and type 2 BMP receptors. Ym155 does not bind the BMP receptors but rather inhibits BMP signaling by inducing the degradation of BMPR2. We show that JL5, DMH1, and Ym155 decreased the expression of ID1 in SD2 and U87 cells. JL5 and Ym155 also decreased the expression of BMPR2 and its downstream target inhibitor of apoptosis protein XIAP. JL5 treatment resulted in significant cell death and suppressed self-renewal to a greater extent than that induced by BMP4 ligand. The lysosome inhibitor chloroquine increases the localization of BMPR2 to the plasma membrane enhancing JL5-induced downregulation of ID1 and cell death in SD2 cells. We show that BMP signaling is growth promoting in GBMs. These studies suggest the need for development of BMP inhibitors and evaluation as potential therapeutic for GBMs.",HL150852,Molecular and cellular biochemistry,2022

Current therapies used to treat coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) include monoclonal antibody cocktail, convalescent plasma, antivirals, immunomodulators, and anticoagulants. The vaccines from Pfizer and Moderna have recently been authorized for emergency use, which are invaluable for the prevention of SARS-CoV-2 infection. However, their long-term side effects are not yet documented, and populations with immunocompromised conditions (e.g., organ-transplantation and immunodeficient patients) may not be able to mount an effective immune response. In addition, there are concerns that wide-scale immunity to SARS-CoV-2 may introduce immune pressure that could select for escape mutants to the existing vaccines and monoclonal antibody therapies. Emerging evidence has shown that chimeric antigen receptor (CAR)- natural killer (NK) immunotherapy has potent antitumor response in hematologic cancers with minimal adverse effects in recent studies, however, the potentials of CAR-NK cells in treating COVID-19 has not yet been fully exploited. Here, we improve upon a novel approach for the generation of CAR-NK cells for targeting SARS-CoV-2 and its various mutants. CAR-NK cells were generated using the scFv domain of S309 (henceforward, S309-CAR-NK), a SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 neutralizing antibody (NAbs) that targets the highly conserved region of SARS-CoV-2 spike (S) glycoprotein and is therefore more likely to recognize different variants of SARS-CoV-2 isolates. S309-CAR-NK cells can specifically bind to pseudotyped SARS-CoV-2 virus and its D614G, N501Y, and E484K mutants. Furthermore, S309-CAR-NK cells can specifically kill target cells expressing SARS-CoV-2 S protein in vitro and show superior killing activity and cytokine production, compared to that of the recently reported CR3022-CAR-NK cells. Thus, these results pave the way for generating 'off-the-shelf' S309-CAR-NK cells for treatment in high-risk individuals as well as provide an alternative strategy for patients unresponsive to current vaccines.",HL150852,Frontiers in immunology,2021

In this study, we investigated the possibility that cell fusion events mediated by the S protein of SARS-CoV-2 and ACE2 interaction can occur in different human cell lines that mimic different tissue origins. These cell lines were stably transduced with either wild-type (WT-S) S protein or a mutated variant where the ER-retention motif was removed (Δ19-S), or human ACE2 vectors. Different co-culture combinations of spike-expressing 293T, A549, K562, and SK-Hep1 cells with hACE2-expressing cells revealed cell hybrid fusion. However, only certain cells expressing S protein can form syncytial structures as this phenomenon cannot be observed in all co-culture combinations. Thus, SARS-CoV-2 mediated cell-cell fusion represents a cell type-dependent process which might rely on a different set of parameters. Recently, the Δ19-S variant is being widely used to increase SARS-CoV-2 pseudovirus production for in vitro assays. Comparison of cell fusion occurring via Δ19-S expressing cells shows defective nuclear fusion and syncytia formation compared to WT-S. This distinction between the Δ19-S variant and WT-S protein may have downstream implications for studies that utilize pseudovirus-based entry assays.

Hydrogel materials have gained significant attention for burn wound treatment in clinical practice among various advanced dressings due to their soothing and moisturizing activity. However, prolonged healing, pain, and traumatic removal due to the lack of long-term wound hydration are some of the challenges in the treatment of second-degree burn wounds. In this study, 3D-printed dressings were fabricated using gelatin, alginate, and bioactive borate glass (BBG) using an extrusion-based bioprinter. After ionic crosslinking, the 3D-printed dressings were characterized for mechanical properties, degradation rate, hydration activity, and in vitro cell viability using human fibroblasts. The results demonstrated that in 3D-printed dressings with 20 wt% BBG, Young's modulus increased by 105%, and 10-day degradation rate decreased by 62%. Addition of BBG prevented the burst release of water from hydrogel dressings and enabled the continuous water release for up to 10 days, which is crucial in treating second-degree burn wounds. 3D-printed hydrogel dressings with BBG showed long-term cell viability that can be a result of the accumulative release of therapeutic ions from BBG particulate. The in vivo wound healing functionality of the dressings was investigated using a rat model with a second-degree burn wound. Our animal study showed that the 3D-printed dressings with BBG exhibited faster wound closure, non-adhesive contact, non-invasive debridement, and non-traumatic dressing removal.

We screened eight peptide candidates using the following criteria: (1) Inhibition and reversion of amyloid beta (Aβ) oligomers, quantified using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA); (2) direct binding of peptide candidates to the human receptor for advanced glycation end-products (RAGE), the Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) and the S100 calcium-binding protein A9 (S100A9), quantified by ELISA; (3) protection against Aβ oligomer-induced neuronal cell death, using trypan blue to measure cell death in a murine neuronal cell line; (4) inhibition of TLR4 activation by S100A9, using a human TLR4 reporter cell line. We selected a 27-mer lead peptide that fulfilled these four criteria. This lead peptide is a privileged structure that displays inherent multitarget activity.

Moreover, MOF-based sensors have attracted considerable attention in the past decade. Recent literature reviews focused on the progress of MOF-based electronic sensors and luminescent MOF sensors, while sensors exploiting the dielectric properties (refractive index) of MOFs were also demonstrated and discussed very recently. The motivation of this report is to provide, for the first time, a general review on such MOF sensors with a particular focus on miniature optical fiber (OF) based MOF sensors and to demonstrate the promising potential of MOFs as dielectric coatings on OF for highly sensitive chemical sensing. The fundamental principle of OF-MOF sensors relies on the tunability of the refractive index of a MOF, which is dependent on the amount and type of adsorbed guest molecules in the MOF pores.

Human kidney organoids can reconstitute PKD cystogenesis in a genetically specific way, but the mechanisms underlying cystogenesis remain elusive. Here we show that subjecting organoids to fluid shear stress in a PKD-on-a-chip microphysiological system promotes cyst expansion via an absorptive rather than a secretory pathway. A diffusive static condition partially substitutes for fluid flow, implicating volume and solute concentration as key mediators of this effect. Surprisingly, cyst-lining epithelia in organoids polarize outwards towards the media, arguing against a secretory mechanism. Rather, cyst formation is driven by glucose transport into lumens of outwards-facing epithelia, which can be blocked pharmacologically. In PKD mice, glucose is imported through cysts into the renal interstitium, which detaches from tubules to license expansion. Thus, absorption can mediate PKD cyst growth in human organoids, with implications for disease mechanism and potential for therapy development.",HL152401,Nature communications,2022

The adhesive film was characterized using AFM, and distinct nanodomains were identified on the exterior surface of the PSA. Our optimized formulation yielded 67% drop in adhesion when warmed to 45 °C, perhaps due to melting nanodomains weakening the adhesive-substrate boundary layer.

Here, we review assays of physiological function in human kidney organoids, including best practices for quality control, and future applications. Tubular structures in organoids accumulate specific molecules through active transport, including dextran and organic anions, and swell with fluid in response to cAMP stimulation. When engrafted into animal models in vivo, organoids form vascularized glomerulus-like structures capable of size-selective filtration.

We meticulously designed a Net-shaped DNA nanostructure and strategically arranged trimeric clusters of aptamers that specifically recognize the spike proteins of SARS-CoV-2. This approach has proven instrumental in bolstering virus-binding affinity on the LFAs. Our findings indicate high LFA sensitivity, enabling the detection of viral loads ranging from 103 to 108 viral copies/mL. This notable sensitivity is maintained across various SARS-CoV-2 viral strains, obviating the need for intricate sample preparation protocols.

We showcase that the NanoGripper can be engineered to interact with and capture various objects with different dimensions, including gold nanoparticles, gold NanoUrchins, and SARS-CoV-2 virions. When carrying multiple DNA aptamer nanoswitches programmed to generate fluorescent signal enhanced on a photonic crystal platform, the NanoGripper functions as a sensitive viral biosensor that detects intact SARS-CoV-2 virions in human saliva with a limit of detection of ~ 100 copies/mL, providing RT-PCR equivalent sensitivity. Additionally, we use confocal microscopy to visualize how the NanoGripper-aptamer complex can effectively block viral entry into the host cells, indicating the viral inhibition. In summary, we report the design, synthesis, and characterization of a complex nanomachine that can be readily tailored for specific applications. The study highlights a path toward novel, feasible, and efficient solutions for the diagnosis and therapy of other diseases such as HIV and influenza.",DE030852,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2023

The lengthy time delays required to obtain test results, the high cost of gold-standard PCR tests, and poor sensitivity of rapid point-of-care tests contributed directly to society's inability to efficiently identify COVID-19-positive individuals for quarantine, which in turn continues to impact return to normal activities throughout the economy. Over the past year, enormous resources have been invested to develop more effective rapid tests and laboratory tests with greater throughput, yet the vast majority of engineering and chemistry approaches are merely incremental improvements to existing methods for nucleic acid amplification, lateral flow test strips, and enzymatic amplification assays for protein-based biomarkers. Meanwhile, widespread commercial availability of new test kits continues to be hampered by the cost and time required to develop single-use disposable microfluidic plastic cartridges manufactured by injection molding. Through development of novel technologies for sensitive, selective, rapid, and robust viral detection and more efficient approaches for scalable manufacturing of microfluidic devices, we can be much better prepared for future management of infectious pathogen outbreaks. Here, we describe how photonic metamaterials, graphene nanomaterials, designer DNA nanostructures, and polymers amenable to scalable additive manufacturing are being applied towards overcoming the fundamental limitations of currently dominant COVID-19 diagnostic approaches.

Herein, we firstly summarized the designs of MNPs from the perspectives of materials and physicochemical properties tailored for biomedical applications. Magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS), first reported in 2006, has flourished as an independent platform for many biological and biomedical applications. It has been extensively reported as a versatile platform for a variety of bioassays along with the artificially designed MNPs, where the MNPs serve as magnetic nanoprobes to specifically probe target analytes from fluid samples.

Traditional disease diagnostic methods such as qRT-PCR (quantitative reverse transcription-PCR) and ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) require multiple steps, trained technicians, and long turnaround time that may worsen the disease surveillance and pandemic control. In sight of this situation, a rapid, one-step, easy-to-use, and high-accuracy diagnostic platform will be valuable for future epidemic control, especially for regions with scarce medical resources. Herein, we report a magnetic particle spectroscopy (MPS) platform for the detection of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) biomarkers: spike and nucleocapsid proteins. This technique monitors the dynamic magnetic responses of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and uses their higher harmonics as a measure of the nanoparticles' binding states. By anchoring polyclonal antibodies (pAbs) onto MNP surfaces, these nanoparticles function as nanoprobes to specifically bind to target analytes (SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins in this work) and form nanoparticle clusters. This binding event causes detectable changes in higher harmonics and allows for quantitative and qualitative detection of target analytes in the liquid phase. We have achieved detection limits of 1.56 nM (equivalent to 125 fmole) and 12.5 nM (equivalent to 1 pmole) for detecting SARS-CoV-2 spike and nucleocapsid proteins, respectively. This MPS platform combined with the one-step, wash-free, nanoparticle clustering-based assay method is intrinsically versatile and allows for the detection of a variety of other disease biomarkers by simply changing the surface functional groups on MNPs.",DE030832,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2021

It relies on the dynamic magnetic responses of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) for the detection of target analytes in the liquid phase. There are many research studies reporting the application of MPS for detecting a variety of analytes including viruses, toxins, nucleic acids, and so forth. Herein, we report a modified version of the MPS platform with the addition of a one-stage lock-in design to remove the feedthrough signals induced by external driving magnetic fields, thus capturing only MNP responses for improved system sensitivity. This one-stage lock-in MPS system is able to detect as low as 781 ng multi-core Nanomag50 iron oxide MNPs (micromod Partikeltechnologie GmbH) and 78 ng single-core SHB30 iron oxide MNPs (Ocean NanoTech). We first demonstrated the performance of this MPS system for bioassay-related applications. Using the SARS-CoV-2 spike protein as a model, we have achieved a detection limit of 125 nM (equal to 5 pmole) for detecting spike protein molecules in the liquid phase. In addition, using a streptavidin-biotin binding system as a proof-of-concept, we show that these single-core SHB30 MNPs can be used for Brownian relaxation-based bioassays while the multi-core Nanomag50 cannot be used. The effects of MNP amount on the concentration-dependent response profiles for detecting streptavidin were also investigated. Results show that by using a lower concentration/ amount of MNPs, concentration-response curves shift to a lower concentration/amount of target analytes. This lower concentration-response indicates the possibility of improved bioassay sensitivities by using lower amounts of MNPs.",DE030832,"The journal of physical chemistry.

However, the quantitative and high accuracy bioassays in large hospitals and laboratories usually require trained technicians and equipment that is both bulky and expensive. In addition, the multistep bioassays and long turnaround time could severely affect the disease surveillance and control especially in pandemics such as influenza and COVID-19. In view of this, a portable, quantitative bioassay device will be valuable in regions with scarce medical resources and help relieve burden on local healthcare systems. Herein, we introduce the MagiCoil diagnostic device, an inexpensive, portable, quantitative, and rapid bioassay platform based on the magnetic particle spectrometer (MPS) technique. MPS detects the dynamic magnetic responses of magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs) and uses the harmonics from oscillating MNPs as metrics for sensitive and quantitative bioassays. This device does not require trained technicians to operate and employs a fully automatic, one-step, and wash-free assay with a user friendly smartphone interface. Using a streptavidin-biotin binding system as a model, we show that the detection limit of the current portable device for streptavidin is 64 nM (equal to 5.12 pmole). In addition, this MPS technique is very versatile and allows for the detection of different diseases just by changing the surface modifications on MNPs. Although MPS-based bioassays show high sensitivities as reported in many literatures, at the current stage, this portable device faces insufficient sensitivity and needs further improvements. It is foreseen that this kind of portable device can transform the multistep, laboratory-based bioassays to one-step field testing in nonclinical settings such as schools, homes, offices, etc.",DE030832,ACS applied materials & interfaces,2021

An objective method with high specificity and high sensitivity to identify current or imminent MIS-C in children infected with SARS-CoV-2 is highly desirable. The aim was to learn about an interpretable novel cytokine/chemokine assay panel providing such an objective classification. This retrospective study was conducted on four groups of pediatric patients seen at multiple sites of Texas Children's Hospital, Houston, TX who consented to provide blood samples to our COVID-19 Biorepository. Standard laboratory markers of inflammation and a novel cytokine/chemokine array were measured in blood samples of all patients. Group 1 consisted of 72 COVID-19, 70 MIS-C and 63 uninfected control patients seen between May 2020 and January 2021 and predominantly infected with pre-alpha variants. Group 2 consisted of 29 COVID-19 and 43 MIS-C patients seen between January and May 2021 infected predominantly with the alpha variant. Group 3 consisted of 30 COVID-19 and 32 MIS-C patients seen between August and October 2021 infected with alpha and/or delta variants. Group 4 consisted of 20 COVID-19 and 46 MIS-C patients seen between October 2021 andJanuary 2022 infected with delta and/or omicron variants. Group 1 was used to train an L1-regularized logistic regression model which was tested using five-fold cross validation, and then separately validated against the remaining naïve groups. The area under receiver operating curve (AUROC) and F1-score were used to quantify the performance of the cytokine/chemokine assay-based classifier. Standard laboratory markers predict MIS-C with a five-fold cross-validated AUROC of 0.86 ± 0.05 and an F1 score of 0.78 ± 0.07, while the cytokine/chemokine panel predicted MIS-C with a five-fold cross-validated AUROC of 0.95 ± 0.02 and an F1 score of 0.91 ± 0.04, with only sixteen of the forty-five cytokines/chemokines sufficient to achieve this performance. Tested on Group 2 the cytokine/chemokine panel yielded AUROC = 0.98 and F1 = 0.93, on Group 3 it yielded AUROC = 0.89 and F1 = 0.89, and on Group 4 AUROC = 0.99 and F1 = 0.97. Adding standard laboratory markers to the cytokine/chemokine panel did not improve performance. A top-10 subset of these 16 cytokines achieves equivalent performance on the validation data sets. Our findings demonstrate that a sixteen-cytokine/chemokine panel as well as the top ten subset provides a highly sensitive, and specific method to identify MIS-C in patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 of all the major variants identified to date.",HD105593,Journal of clinical medicine,2023

Whole blood mRNA transcriptome profiles of 13 neonates with HLHS before and after their first palliative surgery were analyzed to determine differentially expressed genes and pathways. The median age and weight at surgery were 4 days and 3.2 kg, respectively. Of the 13 patients, 8 developed LCOS. There was no significant difference between CPB, aortic cross clamp, deep hypothermic cardiac arrest times between patients that develop LCOS and those that do not. Upon comparing differential gene expression profiles between patients that develop LCOS and those that do not in pre-operative samples, 1 gene was up-regulated and 13 were down regulated. In the post-operative samples, 4 genes were up-regulated, and 4 genes were down regulated when patients that develop LCOS were compared to those that do not. When comparing post-operative samples to pre-operative samples in the patients that do not develop LCOS, 1484 genes were up-regulated, and 1388 genes were down regulated; while patients that developed LCOS had 2423 up-regulated genes, and 2414 down regulated genes for the same pre to post-operative comparison. Pathway analysis revealed differential regulation of inflammatory pathways (IL signaling, PDGF, NOTCH1, NGF, GPCR) and metabolic pathways (heme metabolism, oxidative phosphorylation, protein metabolism including amino acid and derivatives, fatty acid metabolism, TCA cycle and respiratory electron transport chain). By identifying altered transcriptome profiles related to inflammation and metabolism in neonates with HLHS who develop LCOS after CPB, this study opens for exploration novel pathways and potential therapeutic targets to improve outcomes in this high-risk population.",HD105593,Scientific reports,2021

Because of antigenic drift, influenza vaccines are frequently updated, though their efficacy may still be limited due to strain mismatches. Despite the high levels of viral diversity observed across populations, most human studies reveal limited intrahost diversity, leaving the origin of population-level viral diversity unclear. Previous studies show host characteristics, such as immunity, might affect within-host viral evolution. Here we investigate influenza A viral diversity in children aged between 6 months and 18 years. Influenza virus evolution in children is less well characterized than in adults, yet may be associated with higher levels of viral diversity given the lower level of pre-existing immunity and longer durations of infection in children. We obtained influenza isolates from banked influenza A-positive nasopharyngeal swabs collected at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia during the 2017-18 influenza season. Using next-generation sequencing, we evaluated the population of influenza viruses present in each sample. We characterized within-host viral diversity using the number and frequency of intrahost single-nucleotide variants (iSNVs) detected in each sample. We related viral diversity to clinical metadata, including subjects' age, vaccination status, and comorbid conditions, as well as sample metadata such as virus strain and cycle threshold. Consistent with previous studies, most samples contained low levels of diversity with no clear association between the subjects' age, vaccine status, or health status. Further, there was no enrichment of iSNVs near known antigenic sites. Taken together, these findings are consistent with previous observations that the majority of intrahost influenza virus infection is characterized by low viral diversity without evidence of diversifying selection.",HD105594,Virus evolution,2024

We identify the presence of an RSA at the cell apex and a morphologically distinct apical vesicle docking the tips of the two rhoptries to the RSA. We also discover two additional rhoptry organizations that lack the apical vesicle.

At multiple stages during its complex life cycle, P. falciparum expresses several essential proteins tethered to its surface by glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) anchors, which are critical for biological processes such as parasite egress and reinvasion of host red blood cells. Targeting this pathway therapeutically has the potential to broadly impact parasite development across several life stages. Here, we characterize an upstream component of parasite GPI anchor biosynthesis, the putative phosphomannomutase (PMM) (EC 5.4.2.8), HAD5 (PF3D7_1017400). We confirmed the PMM and phosphoglucomutase activities of purified recombinant HAD5 by developing novel linked enzyme biochemical assays. By regulating the expression of HAD5 in transgenic parasites with a TetR-DOZI-inducible knockdown system, we demonstrated that HAD5 is required for malaria parasite egress and erythrocyte reinvasion, and we assessed the role of HAD5 in GPI anchor synthesis by autoradiography of radiolabeled glucosamine and thin layer chromatography. Finally, we determined the three-dimensional X-ray crystal structure of HAD5 and identified a substrate analog that specifically inhibits HAD5 compared to orthologous human PMMs in a time-dependent manner. These findings demonstrate that the GPI anchor biosynthesis pathway is exceptionally sensitive to inhibition in parasites and that HAD5 has potential as a specific, multistage antimalarial target.",HD105594,The Journal of biological chemistry,2022

We developed a tool (GNU-based Virus IDentification [GNUVID]) that integrates whole-genome multilocus sequence typing and a supervised machine learning random forest-based classifier. We used GNUVID to assign sequence type (ST) profiles to all high-quality genomes available from GISAID. STs were clustered into clonal complexes (CCs) and then used to train a machine learning classifier. We used this tool to detect potential introduction and exportation events and to estimate effective viral diversity across locations and over time in 16 US states. GNUVID is a highly scalable tool for viral genotype classification (https://github.com/ahmedmagds/GNUVID) that can quickly classify hundreds of thousands of genomes in a way that is consistent with phylogeny. Our genotyping ST/CC analysis uncovered dynamic local changes in ST/CC prevalence and diversity with multiple replacement events in different states, an average of 20.6 putative introductions and 7.5 exportations for each state over the time period analyzed. We introduce the use of effective diversity metrics (Hill numbers) that can be used to estimate the impact of interventions (e.g., travel restrictions, vaccine uptake, mask mandates) on the variation in circulating viruses. Our classification tool uncovered multiple introduction and exportation events, as well as waves of expansion and replacement of SARS-CoV-2 genotypes in different states.

We determined whether dysfunction is global or regional, and whether it is associated with the cytokine milieu, microangiopathy, or severity of shock. Methods and Results We analyzed echocardiographic parameters of myocardial deformation and compared global and segmental left ventricular strain between 43 cases with MIS-C ≤18 years old and 40 controls. Primary outcomes included left ventricular global longitudinal strain, right ventricular free wall strain), and left atrial strain. We evaluated relationships between strain and profiles of 10 proinflammatory cytokines, microangiopathic features (soluble C5b9), and vasoactive-inotropic requirements. Compared with controls, cases with MIS-C had significant impairments in all parameters of systolic and diastolic function. 65% of cases with MIS-C had abnormal left ventricular function (|global longitudinal strain|<17%), although elevations of cytokines were modest. All left ventricular segments were involved, without apical or basal dominance to suggest acute stress cardiomyopathy. Worse global longitudinal strain correlated with higher ratios of interleukin-6 (ρ -0.43) and interleukin-8 (ρ -0.43) to total hypercytokinemia, but not absolute levels of interleukin-6 or interleukin-8, or total hypercytokinemia. Similarly, worse right ventricular free wall strain correlated with higher relative interleukin-8 expression (ρ -0.59). There were no significant associations between function and microangiopathy or vasoactive-inotropic requirements. Conclusions Myocardial function is globally decreased in MIS-C and not explained by acute stress cardiomyopathy. Cardiac dysfunction may be driven by the relative skew of the immune response toward interleukin-6 and interleukin-8 pathways, more so than degree of hyperinflammation, refining the current paradigm of myocardial involvement in MIS-C.",HD105594,Journal of the American Heart Association,2021

These techniques are relatively expensive, slow, and susceptible to false-negative results. A rapid noninvasive method to detect infection would be highly advantageous. Compelling evidence from canine biosensors and studies of adults with COVID-19 suggests that infection reproducibly alters human volatile organic compound (VOC) profiles. To determine whether pediatric infection is associated with VOC changes, we enrolled SARS-CoV-2 infected and uninfected children admitted to a major pediatric academic medical center. Breath samples were collected from children and analyzed through state-of-the-art GCxGC-ToFMS. Isolated features included 84 targeted VOCs. Candidate biomarkers that were correlated with infection status were subsequently validated in a second, independent cohort of children. We thus find that six volatile organic compounds are significantly and reproducibly increased in the breath of SARS-CoV-2 infected children. Three aldehydes (octanal, nonanal, and heptanal) drew special attention, as aldehydes are also elevated in the breath of adults with COVID-19. Together, these biomarkers demonstrate high accuracy for distinguishing pediatric SARS-CoV-2 infection and support the ongoing development of novel breath-based diagnostics.",HD105594,ACS infectious diseases,2021

In a cohort of 100 patients with cancer who were hospitalized for COVID-19, patients with hematologic cancer had higher mortality relative to patients with solid cancer. In two additional cohorts, flow cytometric and serologic analyses demonstrated that patients with solid cancer and patients without cancer had a similar immune phenotype during acute COVID-19, whereas patients with hematologic cancer had impairment of B cells and severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)-specific antibody responses. Despite the impaired humoral immunity and high mortality in patients with hematologic cancer who also have COVID-19, those with a greater number of CD8 T cells had improved survival, including those treated with anti-CD20 therapy. Furthermore, 77% of patients with hematologic cancer had detectable SARS-CoV-2-specific T cell responses. Thus, CD8 T cells might influence recovery from COVID-19 when humoral immunity is deficient.

One approach to rapid testing is to leverage the volatile organic compound (VOC) signature of SARS-CoV-2 infection. Detection dogs, a biological sensor of VOCs, were utilized to investigate whether SARS-CoV-2 positive urine and saliva patient samples had a unique odor signature. The virus was inactivated in all training samples with either detergent or heat treatment. Using detergent-inactivated urine samples, dogs were initially trained to find samples collected from hospitalized patients confirmed with SARS-CoV-2 infection, while ignoring samples collected from controls. Dogs were then tested on their ability to spontaneously recognize heat-treated urine samples as well as heat-treated saliva from hospitalized SARS-CoV-2 positive patients. Dogs successfully discriminated between infected and uninfected urine samples, regardless of the inactivation protocol, as well as heat-treated saliva samples. Generalization to novel samples was limited, particularly after intensive training with a restricted sample set. A unique odor associated with SARS-CoV-2 infection present in human urine as well as saliva, provides impetus for the development of odor-based screening, either by electronic, chemical, or biological sensing methods. The use of dogs for screening in an operational setting will require training with a large number of novel SARS-CoV-2 positive and confirmed negative samples.",HD105594,PloS one,2021

We sought to determine how cardiac biomarkers might differentiate KD from MIS-C. The International Kawasaki Disease Registry enrolled contemporaneous KD and MIS-C pediatric patients from 42 sites from January 2020 through June 2022. The study population included 118 KD patients who met American Heart Association KD criteria and compared them to 946 MIS-C patients who met 2020 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention case definition. All included patients had at least one measurement of amino-terminal prohormone brain natriuretic peptide (NTproBNP) or cardiac troponin I (TnI), and echocardiography. Regression analyses were used to determine associations between cardiac biomarker levels, diagnosis, and cardiac involvement. Higher NTproBNP (≥ 1500 ng/L) and TnI (≥ 20 ng/L) at presentation were associated with MIS-C versus KD with specificity of 77 and 89%, respectively. Higher biomarker levels were associated with shock and intensive care unit admission; higher NTproBNP was associated with longer hospital length of stay. Lower left ventricular ejection fraction, more pronounced for MIS-C, was also associated with higher biomarker levels. Coronary artery involvement was not associated with either biomarker. Higher NTproBNP and TnI levels are suggestive of MIS-C versus KD and may be clinically useful in their differentiation. Consideration might be given to their inclusion in the routine evaluation of both conditions.",HD105591,Pediatric cardiology,2023

Institutions rapidly assembled task forces to develop treatment algorithms. At the national/international levels, collaboratives and associations assembled consensus writing groups to draft guidelines. These guidelines and algorithms were initially on the basis of expert opinion and small case series. Some groups used the Delphi approach, and the resultant guidelines often mimicked those for other conditions that resembled MIS-C, like Kawasaki disease (KD). For instance, intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a known effective treatment for KD, was recommended for MIS-C. Early in the pandemic many favoured IVIG over steroids as first-line therapy. As evidence evolved so did some guidelines, which now endorse the dual use of IVIG with steroids as first-line therapy. In contrast, withholding immunotherapy became an option for some MIS-C patients with mild symptoms. Herein, we review guidelines and discuss the evidence informing early recommendations, how this has evolved, the role and limitations of expert opinion and observational data, and the importance of leveraging existing research infrastructures, such as the intensive care unit collaborative (Overcoming COVID-19 surveillance registry), and the International Kawasaki Disease Registry. Finally, we discuss strategies to rapidly develop, deploy, and adapt clinical trials evaluating the treatment of such rare conditions in children, which might include alternatives to conventional clinical trial design.

An anonymous survey was completed among potential collaborative Arab medical institutions to assess burden of KD in those countries and resources available to physicians. An online 32-item survey was distributed to participating institutions after conducting face validity. One survey per institution was collected. Nineteen physicians from 12 countries completed the survey representing 19 out of 20 institutions (response rate of 95%). Fifteen (79%) institutions referred to the 2017 American Heart Association guidelines when managing a patient with KD. Intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) is not readily available at 2 institutions (11%) yet available in the country. In one center (5%), IVIG is imported on-demand. The knowledge and awareness among countries' general population was graded (0 to 10) at median/interquartiles (IQR) 3 (2-5) and at median/IQR 7 (6-8) in the medical community outside their institution. Practice variations in KD management and treatment across Arab countries require solid proactive collaboration. The low awareness and knowledge estimates about KD among the general population contrasted with a high level among the medical community.

To investigate innate immune functions in MIS-C, we stimulated ex vivo peripheral blood cells from MIS-C patients with agonists of Toll-like receptors (TLR), key innate immune response initiators. We found severely dampened cytokine responses and elevated gene expression of negative regulators of TLR signaling. Increased plasma levels of zonulin, a gut leakage marker, were also detected. These effects were also observed in children enrolled months after MIS-C recovery. Moreover, cells from MIS-C children carrying rare genetic variants of lysosomal trafficking regulator (LYST) were less refractory to TLR stimulation and exhibited lysosomal and mitochondrial abnormalities with altered energy metabolism. Our results strongly suggest that MIS-C hyperinflammation and/or excessive or prolonged stimulation with gut-originated TLR ligands drive immune cells to a lasting refractory state. TLR hyporesponsiveness is likely beneficial, as suggested by excess lymphopenia among rare LYST variant carriers. Our findings point to cellular mechanisms underlying TLR hyporesponsiveness; identify genetic determinants that may explain the MIS-C clinical spectrum; suggest potential associations between innate refractory states and long COVID; and highlight the need to monitor long-term consequences of MIS-C.",HD105619,medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2024

Serology, which detects the host antibody response to the infection, is the most appropriate tool for this task, since virus-derived markers are most reliably detected during the acute phase of infection. Here we show that our ELISA protocol, which is based on antibody binding to the Receptor Binding Domain (RBD) of the S1 subunit of the viral Spike protein expressed as a novel fusion protein, detects antibody responses to SARS-CoV-2 infection and vaccination. We also show that our ELISA is accurate and versatile. It compares favorably with commercial assays widely used in clinical practice to determine exposure to SARS-CoV-2. Moreover, our protocol accommodates use of various blood- and non-blood-derived biospecimens, such as breast milk, as well as dried blood obtained with microsampling cartridges that are appropriate for remote collection.

We conducted a weighted gene co-expression network analysis (WGCNA) using 935 transcripts differentially expressed between MIS-C and KD using relaxed filtering (unadjusted p < 0.05, >1.1-fold difference). We found seven gene modules in MIS-C, annotated as an increased TNFα/NFκB pathway, decreased EC homeostasis, anti-inflammation and immune response, translation, and glucocorticoid responsive genes and endothelial-mesenchymal transition (EndoMT). To further understand the difference in the EC response between MIS-C and KD, stringent filtering was applied to identify 41 differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between MIS-C and KD (adjusted p < 0.05, >2-fold-difference). Again, in MIS-C, NFκB pathway genes, including nine pro-survival genes, were upregulated. The expression levels were higher in the genes influencing autophagy (UBD, EBI3, and SQSTM1). Other DEGs also supported the finding by WGCNA. Compared to KD, ECs in MIS-C had increased pro-survival transcripts but reduced transcripts related to EndoMT and EC homeostasis.

Notably, a sizeable subpopulation of CD4- CD8- double-negative (DN) T cells out of total CD3+ T cells was observed in MIS-C (median: 14.5%; IQR 8.65-25.3) and recognized SARS-CoV-2 peptides. T cells bearing the Vβ21.3 T cell receptor (TcRs), previously reported as pathogenic in the context of MIS-C, were detected in high frequencies, namely, in 2.8% and 3.9% of the CD4+ and CD8+ T cells, respectively. However, Vβ21.3 CD8+ T cells that responded to SARS-CoV-2 peptides were detected in only a single subject, suggesting recognition of nonviral antigens in the majority of subjects. Subjects studied 6-14 months after MIS-C showed T cell epitope spreading, meaning the activation of T cells that recognize more SARS-CoV-2 peptides following the initial expansion of T cells that see immunodominant epitopes. For example, subjects that did not recognize nonspike proteins in the subacute phase of MIS-C showed good Th response to nonspike peptides, and/or CD8+ T cell responses not appreciable before arose over time and could be detected in the 6-14 months' follow-up. The magnitude of the Th and CTL responses also increased over time.

Children with COVID-19 rarely had autoantibodies; one of 59 children had GAD65 autoantibodies associated with acute onset of insulin-dependent diabetes. While autoantibodies associated with SLE/Sjögren's syndrome (Ro52, Ro60, and La) and/or autoimmune gastritis (gastric ATPase) were detected in 74% (40/54) of MIS-C patients, further analysis of these patients and of children with Kawasaki disease (KD), showed that the administration of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG) was largely responsible for detection of these autoantibodies in both groups of patients. Monitoring in vivo decay of the autoantibodies in MIS-C children showed that the IVIG-derived Ro52, Ro60, and La autoantibodies declined to undetectable levels by 45-60 days, but gastric ATPase autoantibodies declined more slowly requiring >100 days until undetectable. Further testing of IgG and/or IgA antibodies against a subset of potential targets identified by published autoantigen array studies of MIS-C failed to detect autoantibodies against most (16/18) of these proteins in patients with MIS-C who had not received IVIG. However, Troponin C2 and KLHL12 autoantibodies were detected in 2 of 20 and 1 of 20 patients with MIS-C, respectively.

We demonstrate that these scaled datasets enable machine-learning approaches that result in robust prediction of disease status, as well as the ability to detect both known and novel autoantigens, such as PDYN in APS1 patients, and intestinally expressed proteins BEST4 and BTNL8 in IPEX patients. Remarkably, BEST4 antibodies were also found in 2 patients with RAG1/2 deficiency, one of whom had very early onset IBD.

Here, we studied SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells in MIS-C, Kawasaki disease (KD), and SARS-CoV-2 convalescent controls using peptide pools derived from SARS-CoV-2 spike or nonspike proteins, and common cold coronaviruses (CCC). Coordinated CD4+ and CD8+ SARS-CoV-2-specific T cells were detected in five MIS-C subjects with cross-reactivity to CCC. CD4+ and CD8+ T-cell responses alone were documented in three and one subjects, respectively. T-cell specificities in MIS-C did not correlate with disease severity and were similar to SARS-CoV-2 convalescent controls. T-cell memory and cross-reactivity to CCC in MIS-C and SARS-CoV-2 convalescent controls were also similar. The chemokine receptor CCR6, but not CCR9, was highly expressed on SARS-CoV-2-specific CD4+ but not on CD8+ T cells. Only two of 10 KD subjects showed a T-cell response to CCC. Enumeration of myeloid APCs revealed low cell precursors in MIS-C subjects compared to KD. In summary, children with MIS-C mount a normal T-cell response to SARS-CoV-2 with no apparent relationship to antecedent CCC exposure.

Kawasaki disease (KD) shares several clinical features with MIS-C, which prompted the use of intravenous immunoglobulin (IVIG), a mainstay therapy for KD. Both diseases share a robust activation of the innate immune system, including the IL-1 signaling pathway, and IL-1 blockade has been used for the treatment of both MIS-C and KD. The mechanism of action of IVIG in these 2 diseases and the cellular source of IL-1β have not been defined.METHODSThe effects of IVIG on peripheral blood leukocyte populations from patients with MIS-C and KD were examined using flow cytometry and mass cytometry (CyTOF) and live-cell imaging.RESULTSCirculating neutrophils were highly activated in patients with KD and MIS-C and were a major source of IL-1β. Following IVIG treatment, activated IL-1β+ neutrophils were reduced in the circulation. In vitro, IVIG was a potent activator of neutrophil cell death via PI3K and NADPH oxidase, but independently of caspase activation.CONCLUSIONSActivated neutrophils expressing IL-1β can be targeted by IVIG, supporting its use in both KD and MIS-C to ameliorate inflammation.FUNDINGPatient Centered Outcomes Research Institute; NIH; American Asthma Foundation; American Heart Association; Novo Nordisk Foundation; NIGMS; American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Foundation.",HD105590,The Journal of clinical investigation,2021

The pathophysiological mechanisms leading to severe disease are poorly understood. This study leveraged clinical samples from a well-characterized cohort of children hospitalized with COVID-19 or MIS-C to compare immune-mediated biomarkers. Our objective was to identify selected immune molecules that could explain, in part, why certain SARS-CoV-2-infected children developed MIS-C. We hypothesized that type-2 helper T cell-mediated inflammation can elicit autoantibodies, which may account for some of the differences observed between the moderate-severe COVID-19 (COVID+) and MIS-C cohort. We enumerated blood leukocytes and measured levels of selected serum cytokines, chemokines, antibodies to COVID-19 antigens, and autoantibodies in children presenting to an academic medical center in Connecticut, United States. The neutrophil/lymphocyte and eosinophil/lymphocyte ratios were significantly higher in those in the MIS-C versus COVID+ cohort. IgM and IgA, but not IgG antibodies to SARS-CoV-2 receptor binding domain were significantly higher in the MIS-C cohort than the COVID+ cohort. The serum levels of certain type-2 cytokines (interleukin (IL)-4, IL-5, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10, IL-13, and IL-33) were significantly higher in children with MIS-C compared to the COVID+ and SARS-CoV-2-negative cohorts. IgG autoantibodies to brain antigens and pentraxin were higher in children with MIS-C compared to SARS-CoV-19-negative controls, and children with MIS-C had higher levels of IgG anti-contactin-associated protein-like 2 (caspr2) compared to the COVID+ and SARS-CoV-19-negative controls.

Results In seven months before social media posting, only eight patients were enrolled. One week after social media posting began, the median weekly enrollment increased (0 to 3). In the regression model, neither social media post day nor the pediatric SARS-CoV-2 case rate was significantly associated with enrollment rate. However, the interaction of a post day and the pediatric case rate was significant. Conclusion Social media posts significantly increased enrollment among children with mild COVID-19 in a prospective study.

Climate change is fueled by industrialization and the emission of greenhouse gases and leads to a range of effects, such as the redistribution of disease vectors, higher risks of disease transmission, and shifts in disease patterns. Rising temperatures pose risks to both food supplies and respiratory health. The hypothesis addressed is that environmental stressors including a spectrum of chemical and pathogen exposures as well as physical and psychological influences collectively impact genetics, metabolism, and cellular functions affecting physical and mental health. The objective is to report the mechanistic associations linking environment and health. As environmental stressors intensify, a surge in health conditions, spanning from allergies to neurodegenerative diseases, becomes evident; however, linkage to genetic-altered proteomics is more hidden. Investigations positing that environmental stressors cause mitochondrial dysfunction, metabolic syndrome, and oxidative stress, which affect missense variants and neuro- and immuno-disorders, are reported. These disruptions to homeostasis with dyslipidemia and misfolded and aggregated proteins increase susceptibility to cancers, infections, and autoimmune diseases. Proposed interventions, such as vitamin B supplements and antioxidants, target oxidative stress and may aid mitochondrial respiration and immune balance. The mechanistic interconnections of environmental stressors and disruptions in health need to be unraveled to develop strategies to protect public health.",HD105613,International journal of environmental research and public health,2023

To date, in the United States more than 8,862 cases of MIS-C have been identified and 72 deaths have occurred. This syndrome typically affects children between the ages of 5-13; 57% are Hispanic/Latino/Black/non-Hispanic, 61% of patients are males and 100% have either tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 or had direct contact with someone with COVID-19. Unfortunately, diagnosis of MIS-C is difficult, and delayed diagnosis can lead to cardiogenic shock, intensive care admission, and prolonged hospitalization. There is no validated biomarker for the rapid diagnosis of MIS-C. In this study, we used Grating-coupled Fluorescence Plasmonic (GCFP) microarray technology to develop biomarker signatures in pediatric salvia and serum samples from patients with MIS-C in the United States and Colombia. GCFP measures antibody-antigen interactions at individual regions of interest (ROIs) on a gold-coated diffraction grating sensor chip in a sandwich immunoassay to generate a fluorescent signal based on analyte presence within a sample. Using a microarray printer, we designed a first-generation biosensor chip with the capability of capturing 33 different analytes from 80  μ L  of sample (saliva or serum). Here, we show potential biomarker signatures in both saliva and serum samples in six patient cohorts. In saliva samples, we noted occasional analyte outliers on the chip within individual samples and were able to compare those samples to 16S RNA microbiome data. These comparisons indicate differences in relative abundance of oral pathogens within those patients. Microsphere Immunoassay (MIA) of immunoglobulin isotypes was also performed on serum samples and revealed MIS-C patients had several COVID antigen-specific immunoglobulins that were significantly higher than other cohorts, thus identifying potential new targets for the second-generation biosensor chip. MIA also identified additional biomarkers for our second-generation chip, verified biomarker signatures generated on the first-generation chip, and aided in second-generation chip optimization. Interestingly, MIS-C samples from the United States had a more diverse and robust signature than the Colombian samples, which was also illustrated in the MIA cytokine data. These observations identify new MIS-C biomarkers and biomarker signatures for each of the cohorts. Ultimately, these tools may represent a potential diagnostic tool for use in the rapid identification of MIS-C.",HD105613,Frontiers in bioengineering and biotechnology,2023

Sample preparation involves extracting, purifying, and concentrating nucleic acids from various matrices. These processes are critical for ensuring the accuracy and sensitivity of downstream nucleic acid amplification and detection. However, current sample preparation methods are often laboratory-based, requiring specialized equipment, trained personnel, and several hours of processing time. As a result, sample preparation often limits the speed, portability, and cost-effectiveness of point-of-need nucleic acid testing. A universal, field-deployable sample preparation device is highly desirable for this critical need and unmet challenge. Here we reported a handheld, battery-powered, reconfigurable, and field-deployable nucleic acid sample preparation device. A programmable electromagnetic actuator was developed to drive a magnetic robot (ProMagBot) in X/Y 2D space, such that various magnetic bead-based sample preparations can be readily translated from the laboratory to point-of-need settings. The control of the electromagnetic actuator requires only a 3-phase unipolar voltage in X and Y directions, and therefore, the motion space is highly scalable. We validated the ProMagBot device with a model application by extracting HIV viral RNAs from plasma samples using two widely used magnetic bead kits: ChargeSwitch and MagMAX beads. In both cases, the ProMagBot could successfully extract viral RNAs from 50 μL plasma samples containing as low as 102 copies of viral RNAs in 20 minutes. Our results demonstrated the ability of ProMagBot to prepare samples from complex mediums at the point of need. We believe such a device would enable rapid and robust sample preparation in various settings, including resource-limited or remote environments, and accelerate the development of next-generation point-of-need nucleic acid testing.",HD105610,Lab on a chip,2023

Another barrier facing salivary miRNA biomarker research is a lack of recognized ""control miRNAs"". In one of the largest studies of human salivary miRNA to date (922 healthy individuals), we utilized 1225 saliva samples to quantify variability in miRNA expression resulting from aligner selection (Bowtie1 vs. Bowtie2), saliva collection method (expectorated vs. swabbed), RNA stabilizer (presence vs. absence), and individual biological factors (sex, age, body mass index, exercise, caloric intake). Differential expression analyses revealed that absence of RNA stabilizer introduced the greatest variability, followed by differences in methods of collection and aligner. Biological factors generally affected a smaller number of miRNAs. We also reported coefficients of variations for 643 miRNAs consistently present in saliva, highlighting several salivary miRNAs to serve as reference genes. Thus, the results of this analysis can be used by researchers to optimize parameters of salivary miRNA measurement, exclude miRNAs confounded by numerous biologic factors, and identify appropriate miRNA controls.",HD105610,Genes,2022

Ordinal regression is a method to predict ordinal labels that finds a wide range of applications in data-rich domains, such as natural, health and social sciences. Most existing ordinal regression approaches work well for independent and identically distributed (IID) instances via formulating a single ordinal regression task. However, for heterogeneous non-IID instances with well-defined local geometric structures, e.g., subpopulation groups, multi-task learning (MTL) provides a promising framework to encode task (subgroup) relatedness, bridge data from all tasks, and simultaneously learn multiple related tasks in efforts to improve generalization performance. Even though MTL methods have been extensively studied, there is barely existing work investigating MTL for heterogeneous data with ordinal labels. We tackle this important problem via sparse and deep multi-task approaches. Specifically, we develop a regularized multi-task ordinal regression (MTOR) model for smaller datasets and a deep neural networks based MTOR model for large-scale datasets. We evaluate the performance using three real-world healthcare datasets with applications to multi-stage disease progression diagnosis. Our experiments indicate that the proposed MTOR models markedly improve the prediction performance comparing with single-task ordinal regression models.",HD105610,Data mining and knowledge discovery,2021

Herein, the detection of SARS-CoV-2-infected individuals was explored using noninvasive sampling and low-preparatory-work analytical instrumentation. Hand odor samples were obtained from SARS-CoV-2-positive and -negative individuals. The volatile organic compounds (VOCs) were extracted from the collected hand odor samples using solid phase microextraction (SPME) and analyzed using gas chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry (GC-MS). Sparse partial least squares discriminant analysis (sPLS-DA) was used to develop predictive models using the suspected variant sample subsets.

Walnut kernels were assigned a class n depending on their level of freshness as determined by a peroxide assay. VOC samples were analyzed using GC-DMS. From these VOC data, a partial least square regression (PLSR) model provided a freshness prediction value m, which corresponded to the rancid class n when m=n±0.5. The PLSR model had an accuracy of 80% to predict walnut grade and demonstrated a minimal root mean squared error of 0.42 for the m response variables (representative of walnut grade) with the GC-DMS data. We also conducted gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) experiments to identify volatiles that emerged or were enhanced with more rancid walnuts.

Simultaneous collection of breath VOCs and background environmental VOCs is important to ensure analyses eliminate exogenous compounds from clinical studies. We present a mobile sampling system to extract gaseous VOCs onto commercially available sorbent-packed thermal desorption tubes. The sampler can be connected to a number of commonly available disposable and reusable sampling bags, in the case of this study, a Tedlar bag containing a breath sample. Alternatively, the inlet can be left open to directly sample room or environmental air when obtaining a background VOC sample. The system contains a screen for the operator to input a desired sample volume. A needle valve allows the operator to control the sample flow rate, which operates with an accuracy of -1.52 ± 0.63% of the desired rate, and consistently generated that rate with 0.12 ± 0.06% error across repeated measures. A flow pump, flow sensor and microcontroller allow volumetric sampling, as opposed to timed sampling, with 0.06 ± 0.06% accuracy in the volume extracted. Four samplers were compared by sampling a standard chemical mixture, which resulted in 6.4 ± 4.7% error across all four replicate modular samplers to extract a given VOC. The samplers were deployed in a clinical setting to collect breath and background/environmental samples, including patients with active SARS-CoV-2 infections, and the device could easily move between rooms and can undergo required disinfection protocols to prevent transmission of pathogens on the case exterior.

We first studied the non-specific effects of planned seasonal influenza vaccines on breath metabolites in healthy subjects after receiving the immunization. We then investigated changes in breath content from hospitalized patients with flu-like symptoms and confirmed upper respiratory viral infection.

In this study, we continue development of a volatile organic compound (VOC)-based test for detecting asymptomatic infections of P. ramorum in Rhododendron sp. We confirmed detection of P. ramorum from volatiles collected from asymptomatic root-inoculated Rhododendron plants in a nursery setting, finding that the VOC profile of infected plants is detectably different from that of healthy plants, when measured from both ambient VOC emissions and VOCs extracted from leaf material. Predicting infection status was successful from ambient volatiles, which had a mean area under the curve (AUC) value of 0.71 ± 0.17, derived from corresponding receiver operating characteristic curves from an extreme gradient boosting discriminant analysis. This finding compares with that of extracted leaf volatiles, which resulted in a lower AUC value of 0.51 ± 0.21. In a growth chamber, we contrasted volatile profiles of asymptomatic Rhododendron plants having roots infected with one of three pathogens: P. ramorum, P. cactorum, and Rhizoctonia solani. Each pathogen induced unique and measurable changes, but generally the infections reduced volatile emissions until 17 weeks after inoculation, when emissions trended upward relative to those of mock-inoculated controls.

Among environmental contaminant nonessential metals, antimony has been less addressed. Recent Advances: Among environmental contaminant nonessential metals, several metals such as lead, arsenic, and cadmium have been associated with the increased risk of CVDs. Antimony has been less addressed, but its potential link to CVDs is being gradually recognized. Critical Issues: Several epidemiological studies have revealed the significant deleterious effects of antimony on the cardiovascular system in the absence or presence of other nonessential metals. There has been less focus on whether antimony alone can contribute to the pathogenesis of CVDs and the proposed mechanisms of such possible effects. This review addresses this gap in knowledge by presenting the current available evidence that highlights the potential role of antimony in the pathogenesis of CVDs, most likely via antimony-mediated redox dyshomeostasis.

Gene and protein expression defines several neutrophil clusters in COVID-19, including the emergence of low density neutrophils (LDN) that are associated with severe disease. The functional capabilities of these neutrophil clusters and correlation with gene and protein expression are unknown. To define host defense and immunosuppressive functions of normal density neutrophils (NDN) and LDN from COVID-19 patients, we recruited 64 patients with severe COVID-19 and 26 healthy donors (HD). Phagocytosis, respiratory burst activity, degranulation, neutrophil extracellular trap (NET) formation, and T-cell suppression in those neutrophil subsets were measured. NDN from severe/critical COVID-19 patients showed evidence of priming with enhanced phagocytosis, respiratory burst activity, and degranulation of secretory vesicles and gelatinase and specific granules, while NET formation was similar to HD NDN. COVID LDN response was impaired except for enhanced NET formation. A subset of COVID LDN with intermediate CD16 expression (CD16Int LDN) promoted T cell proliferation to a level similar to HD NDN, while COVID NDN and the CD16Hi LDN failed to stimulate T-cell activation. All 3 COVID-19 neutrophil populations suppressed stimulation of IFN-γ production, compared to HD NDN. We conclude that NDN and LDN from COVID-19 patients possess complementary functional capabilities that may act cooperatively to determine disease severity. We predict that global neutrophil responses that induce COVID-19 ARDS will vary depending on the proportion of neutrophil subsets.",TR003787,Frontiers in immunology,2022

WWTP workers occupationally exposed to wastewater can be at risk of respiratory or gastrointestinal diseases. The study objectives were to: (1) quantify pathogens and pathogen indicators in wastewater aerosols near different WWTP processes/unit operations, (2) develop a QMRA model for multi-pathogen and multi-exposure pathway risks, and (3) create a web-based application to perform and communicate risk calculations for wastewater workers. Case studies for seven different WWTP job tasks were performed investigating infection risk across nine different enteric and respiratory pathogens. It was observed that the ingestion risk among job tasks was highest for ""walking the WWTP,"" which involved exposure from splashing, bioaerosols, and hand-to-mouth contact from touching contaminated surfaces. There was also a notable difference in exposure risk during peak (5:00am-9:00am) and non-peak hours (9:00am- 5:00am), with risks during the peak flow hours of the early morning assumed to be 5 times greater than non-peak hours. N95 respirator usage reduced median respiratory risks by 77 %. The developed tool performs multiple QMRA calculations to estimate WWTP workers' infection risks from accidental ingestion or inhalation of wastewater from multiple pathogens and exposure scenarios, which can inform risk management strategies to protect occupational health.

The objective of this study was to analyze whether wastewater surveillance can be used to decrease the intensity of clinical testing while maintaining reliable measurements of diseases incidence on campus. Twelve months of human health and wastewater surveillance data for eight residential buildings on a university campus were analyzed to establish how SARS-CoV-2 levels in the wastewater can be used to minimize clinical testing burden on students. Wastewater SARS-CoV-2 levels were used to create multiple scenarios, each with differing levels of testing intensity, which were compared to the actual testing volumes implemented by the university. We found that scenarios in which testing intensity fluctuations matched rise and falls in SARS-CoV-2 wastewater levels had stronger correlations between SARS-CoV-2 levels and recorded clinical positives. In addition to stronger correlations, most scenarios resulted in overall fewer weekly clinical tests performed.

This strategy was based upon wastewater RNA measurements of the viral target, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2). The utility of WBS for assessing the spread of COVID-19 has motivated research to measure targets beyond SARS-CoV-2, including pathogens containing DNA. The objective of this study was to establish the necessary steps for isolating DNA from wastewater by modifying a long-standing RNA-specific extraction workflow optimized for SARS-CoV-2 detection. Modifications were made to the sample concentration process and included an evaluation of bead bashing prior to the extraction of either DNA or RNA. Results showed that bead bashing reduced detection of RNA from wastewater but improved recovery of DNA as assessed by quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR). Bead bashing is therefore not recommended for the quantification of RNA viruses using qPCR. Whereas for Mycobacterium bacterial DNA isolation, bead bashing was necessary for improving qPCR quantification. Overall, we recommend 2 separate workflows, one for RNA viruses that does not include bead bashing and one for other microbes that use bead bashing for DNA isolation. The experimentation done here shows that current-standing WBS program methodologies optimized for SARS-CoV-2 need to be modified and reoptimized to allow for alternative pathogens to be readily detected and monitored, expanding its utility as a tool for public health assessment.",DA053941,Journal of biomolecular techniques : JBT,2023

It was previously reported that various viruses could interact with the host's ADAR enzymes, resulting in epigenetic changes both to the virus and the host. Here, we analyze RNA-seq of nasopharyngeal swab specimens as well as whole-blood samples of COVID-19 infected individuals and show a significant elevation in the global RNA editing activity in COVID-19 compared to healthy controls. We also detect specific coding sites that exhibit higher editing activity.

Currently, WBT practitioners do not employ a standardized ethical review process, introducing the potential for adverse outcomes for WBT professionals and community members. To address this deficiency, an interdisciplinary workshop developed a framework for a structured ethical review of WBT. The workshop employed a consensus approach to create this framework as a set of 11 questions derived from primarily public health guidance.

Caudoviricetes species are ubiquitous on surface habitats in the BEs, and some of them are distinct from those present in other environments. Antimicrobial resistance genes are identified in viruses inhabiting surfaces frequently touched by occupants and in viruses inhabiting occupants' skin.

Two sets of experiments were conducted, in tandem with the same wastewater, with samples collected at the building, cluster, and community sewershed scales. The first set of experiments focused on evaluating degradation of microbiological targets: SARS-CoV-2, Simian Immunodeficiency Virus (SIV) - a surrogate spiked into the wastewater, plus human waste indicators of Pepper Mild Mottle Virus (PMMoV), Beta-2 microglobulin (B2M), and fecal coliform bacteria (FC). The second focused on the variability of these targets from samples, collected each hour on the hour. Results show that SARS-CoV-2, PMMoV, and B2M were relatively stable, with minimal degradation over 24-h. SIV, which was spiked-in prior to analysis, degraded significantly and FC increased significantly over the course of 24 h, emphasizing the possibility for decay and growth within wastewater. Hour-to-hour variability of the source wastewater was large between each hour of sampling relative to the variability of the SARS-CoV-2 levels calculated between sewershed scales; thus, differences in SARS-CoV-2 hourly variability were not statistically significant between sewershed scales. Results further provided that the quantified representativeness of 24-h composite samples (i.e., statistical equivalency compared against hourly collected grabs) was dependent upon the molecular target measured.

We have developed a high throughput device called ""MINI"" that is capable of testing hundreds of samples per day at the point-of-care. MINI can utilize multiple energy sources - electricity, flame, or solar - to perform loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) in a portable and robust device which is ideal for use in limited resource settings. The unique opto-electronic design of MINI minimizes the energy and space requirements of the device and maximizes the optical isolation and signal clarity, enabling point-of-care analysis of 96 unique samples at once. We show comparable performance to a commercial instrument using two different LAMP assays for Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus and a common housekeeping gene, GAPDH. With a single device capable of running hundreds of samples per day, increased access to modern molecular diagnostics could improve health outcomes for a variety of diseases common in limited resource settings.",DA053941,Biosensors & bioelectronics,2022

Non-potable water reuse represents the largest potential reuse market. Yet economic constraints for new water reuse infrastructure and safety concerns due to microbial water quality, and especially viral pathogen exposure, limit widespread implementation of water reuse. Cost-effective, real-time methods to measure or indicate viral quality of recycled water would do much to instill greater confidence in the practice. This manuscript discusses advancements in monitoring and modeling of viral health risks in the context of water reuse. First, we describe the current wastewater reclamation processes and treatment technologies with an emphasis on virus removal. Second, we review technologies for the measurement of viruses, both culture- and molecular-based, along with their advantages and disadvantages. We introduce promising viral surrogates and specific pathogenic viruses that can serve as indicators of viral risk for water reuse. We suggest metagenomic analyses for viral screening and flow cytometry for quantification of virus-like particles as new approaches to complement more traditional methods. Third, we describe modeling to assess health risks through quantitative microbial risk assessments (QMRAs), the most common strategy to couple data on virus concentrations with human exposure scenarios. We then explore the potential of artificial neural networks (ANNs) to incorporate suites of data from wastewater treatment processes, water quality parameters, and viral surrogates. We recommend ANNs as a means to utilize existing water quality data, alongside new complementary measures of viral quality, to achieve cost-effective strategies to assess risks associated with infectious human viruses in recycled water. Given the review, we conclude that technologies are ready for identifying and implementing viral surrogates for health risk reduction in the next decade. Incorporating modeling with monitoring data would likely result in more robust assessment of water reuse risk.",DA053941,Water,2022

The current gold standard for molecular diagnostics is the polymerase chain reaction (PCR), but the extraordinary and unmet demand for testing in a variety of environments means that both complementary and supplementary testing solutions are still needed. This review highlights the role that loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) has had in filling this global testing need, providing a faster and easier means of testing, and what it can do for future applications, pathogens, and the preparation for future outbreaks.

Where the pandemic has been controlled, extremely high rates of diagnostic testing for the SARS-CoV-2 virus have proven critical, enabling isolation of cases and contact tracing. Recently, diagnostic testing has been supplemented with wastewater measures to evaluate the degree to which communities have infections. Whereas much testing has been done through traditional, centralized, clinical, or environmental laboratory methods, point-of-care testing has proven successful in reducing time to result. As the pandemic progresses and becomes more broadly distributed, further decentralization of diagnostic testing will be helpful to mitigate its spread. This will be particularly both challenging and critical in settings with limited resources due to lack of medical infrastructure and expertise as well as requirements to return results quickly. In this article, we validate the tiny isothermal nucleic acid quantification system (TINY) and a novel loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP)-based assay for the point-of-care diagnosis of SARS-CoV-2 infection in humans and also for in-the-field, point-of-collection surveillance of wastewater. The TINY system is portable and designed for use in settings with limited resources. It can be powered by electrical, solar, or thermal energy and is robust against interruptions in services. These applied testing examples demonstrate that this novel detection platform is a simpler procedure than reverse-transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction, and moreover, this TINY instrument and LAMP assay combination has the potential to effectively provide both point-of-care diagnosis of individuals and point-of-collection environmental surveillance using wastewater.",DA053941,Journal of biomolecular techniques : JBT,2021

We report here on lessons learned from establishing a WBS program for SARS-CoV-2 integrated with a human surveillance program for COVID-19. We have established WBS at three campuses of a university, including student residential dormitories and a hospital that treats COVID-19 patients. Lessons learned from this WBS program address the variability of water quality, new detection technologies, the range of detectable viral loads in wastewater, and the predictive value of integrating environmental and human surveillance data. Data from our WBS program indicated that water quality was statistically different between sewer sampling sites, with more variability observed in wastewater coming from individual buildings compared to clusters of buildings. A new detection technology was developed based upon the use of a novel polymerase called V2G. Detectable levels of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater varied from 102 to 106 genomic copies (gc) per liter of raw wastewater (L). Integration of environmental and human surveillance data indicate that WBS detection of 100 gc/L of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater was associated with a positivity rate of 4% as detected by human surveillance in the wastewater catchment area, though confidence intervals were wide (β ~ 8.99 ∗ ln(100); 95% CI = 0.90-17.08; p < 0.05).

To address these challenges, we designed a fast (30-minute) colorimetric test (LAMP) for SARS-CoV-2 infection from naso/oropharyngeal swabs and a large-scale shotgun metatranscriptomics platform (total-RNA-seq) for host, viral, and microbial profiling.

Both symptomatic and asymptomatic patients with COVID-19 can shed the virus through the gastrointestinal tract, enabling the quantification of the virus in stool and ultimately in wastewater (WW). Unfortunately, instability of SARS-CoV-2 RNA in wastewater limits the utility of WBE programs, particularly in remote/rural regions where reliable cold storage and/or rapid shipping may be unavailable. This study examined whether rapid SARS-CoV-2 RNA extraction on the day of sample collection could minimize degradation. Importantly, the extraction technology used in these experiments, termed exclusion-based sample preparation (ESP), is lightweight, portable, and electricity-free, making it suitable for implementation in remote settings. We demonstrated that immediate RNA extraction followed by ambient storage significantly increased the RNA half-life compared to raw wastewater samples stored at both 4 °C or ambient temperature. Given that RNA degradation negatively impacts both the sensitivity and precision of WBE measurements, efforts must be made to mitigate degradation in order to maximize the potential impact of WBE on public health.",DA053903,The Science of the total environment,2023

However, implementation of wastewater monitoring of SARS-CoV-2 is limited due to the need for expert staff, expensive equipment, and prolonged processing times. As WBE increases in scope (beyond SARS-CoV-2) and scale (beyond developed regions), there is a need to make WBE processes simpler, cheaper, and faster. We developed an automated workflow based on a simplified method termed exclusion-based sample preparation (ESP). Our automated workflow takes 40 min from raw wastewater to purified RNA, which is several times faster than conventional WBE methods. The total assay cost per sample/replicate is $6.50 which includes consumables and reagents for concentration, extraction, and RT-qPCR quantification. The assay complexity is reduced significantly, as extraction and concentration steps are integrated and automated. The high recovery efficiency of the automated assay (84.5 ± 25.4%) yielded an improved Limit of Detection (LoDAutomated=40 copies/mL) compared to the manual process (LoDManual=206 copies/mL), increasing analytical sensitivity. We validated the performance of the automated workflow by comparing it with the manual method using wastewater samples from several locations. The results from the two methods correlated strongly (r = 0.953), while the automated method was shown to be more precise. In 83% of the samples, the automated method showed lower variation between replicates, which is likely due to higher technical errors in the manual process e.g., pipetting.

Beginning in early 2021, we implemented a targeted approach to amplify and sequence the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-COV-2 to characterize viral lineages present in sewersheds. Over the course of 2021, we reproducibly detected multiple SARS-COV-2 RBD lineages that have never been observed in patient samples in 9 sewersheds located in 3 states in the USA. These cryptic lineages contained between 4 to 24 amino acid substitutions in the RBD and were observed intermittently in the sewersheds in which they were found for as long as 14 months. Many of the amino acid substitutions in these lineages occurred at residues also mutated in the Omicron variant of concern (VOC), often with the same substitutions. One of the sewersheds contained a lineage that appeared to be derived from the Alpha VOC, but the majority of the lineages appeared to be derived from pre-VOC SARS-COV-2 lineages. Specifically, several of the cryptic lineages from New York City appeared to be derived from a common ancestor that most likely diverged in early 2020. While the source of these cryptic lineages has not been resolved, it seems increasingly likely that they were derived from long-term patient infections or animal reservoirs. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-COV-2 genetic diversity is greater than what is commonly observed through routine SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Wastewater sampling may more fully capture SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity than patient sampling and could reveal new VOCs before they emerge in the wider human population.",DA053893,PLoS pathogens,2022

Normalizing SARS-CoV-2 concentrations by the population biomarkers in wastewater is critical for interpreting the viral loads, comparing the epidemiological trends among the sewersheds, and identifying the vulnerable communities. In this study, five population biomarkers, pepper mild mottle virus (PMMoV), creatinine (CRE), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), caffeine (CAF) and its metabolite paraxanthine (PARA) were investigated and validated for their utility in normalizing the SARS-CoV-2 loads through two normalizing approaches using the data from 64 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Missouri. Their utility in assessing the real-time population contributing to the wastewater was also evaluated. The best performing candidate was further tested for its capacity for improving correlation between normalized SARS-CoV-2 loads and the clinical cases reported in the City of Columbia, Missouri, a university town with a constantly fluctuating population. Our results showed that, except CRE, the direct and indirect normalization approaches using biomarkers allow accounting for the changes in wastewater dilution and differences in relative human waste input over time regardless flow volume and population of the given WWTP. Among selected biomarkers, PARA is the most reliable population biomarker in determining the SARS-CoV-2 load per capita due to its high accuracy, low variability, and high temporal consistency to reflect the change in population dynamics and dilution in wastewater. It also demonstrated its excellent utility for real-time assessment of the population contributing to the wastewater.

Efforts have been made to use the wastewater SARS-CoV-2 viral load to predict the infected population within each sewershed using a multivariable regression approach. However, reported clear and sustained variability in SARS-CoV-2 viral load among treatment facilities receiving industrial wastewater have made clinical prediction challenging. Several classes of molecules released by regional industries and manufacturing facilities, particularly the food processing industry, can significantly suppress the SARS-CoV-2 signals in wastewater by breaking down the lipid-bilayer of the membranes. Therefore, a systematic ranking process in conjugation with metabolomic analysis was developed to identify the wastewater treatment facilities exhibiting SARS-CoV-2 suppression and identify and quantify the chemicals suppressing the SARS-COV-2 signals. By ranking the viral load per diagnosed case among the sewersheds, we successfully identified the wastewater treatment facilities in Missouri, USA that exhibit SARS-CoV-2 suppression (significantly lower than 5 × 1011 gene copies/reported case) and determined their suppression rates. Through both untargeted global chemical profiling and targeted analysis of wastewater samples, 40 compounds were identified as candidates of SARS-CoV-2 signal suppressors. Among these compounds, 14 had higher concentrations in wastewater treatment facilities that exhibited SARS-CoV-2 signal suppression compared to the unsuppressed control facilities. Stepwise regression analyses indicated that 4-nonylphenol, palmitelaidic acid, sodium oleate, and polyethylene glycol dioleate are positively correlated with SARS-CoV-2 signal suppression rates. Suppression activities were further confirmed by incubation studies, and the suppression kinetics for each bioactive compound were determined. According to the results of these experiments, bioactive molecules in wastewater can significantly reduce the stability of SARS-CoV-2 genetic marker signals. Based on the concentrations of these chemical suppressors, a correction factor could be developed to achieve more reliable and unbiased surveillance results for wastewater treatment facilities that receive wastewater from similar industries.",DA053893,Water research,2022

Beginning in early 2021, we implemented a targeted approach to amplify and sequence the receptor binding domain (RBD) of SARS-COV-2 to characterize viral lineages present in sewersheds. Over the course of 2021, we reproducibly detected multiple SARS-COV-2 RBD lineages that have never been observed in patient samples in 9 sewersheds located in 3 states in the USA. These cryptic lineages contained between 4 to 24 amino acid substitutions in the RBD and were observed intermittently in the sewersheds in which they were found for as long as 14 months. Many of the amino acid substitutions in these lineages occurred at residues also mutated in the Omicron variant of concern (VOC), often with the same substitution. One of the sewersheds contained a lineage that appeared to be derived from the Alpha VOC, but the majority of the lineages appeared to be derived from pre-VOC SARS-COV-2 lineages. Specifically, several of the cryptic lineages from New York City appeared to be derived from a common ancestor that most likely diverged in early 2020. While the source of these cryptic lineages has not been resolved, it seems increasingly likely that they were derived from immunocompromised patients or animal reservoirs. Our findings demonstrate that SARS-COV-2 genetic diversity is greater than what is commonly observed through routine SARS-CoV-2 surveillance. Wastewater sampling may more fully capture SARS-CoV-2 genetic diversity than patient sampling and could reveal new VOCs before they emerge in the wider human population.",DA053893,medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2022

Normalizing SARS-CoV-2 concentrations by the population biomarkers in wastewater can be critical for interpreting the viral loads, comparing the epidemiological trends among the sewersheds, and identifying the vulnerable communities. In this study, five population biomarkers, pepper mild mottle virus (pMMoV), creatinine (CRE), 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), caffeine (CAF) and its metabolite paraxanthine (PARA) were investigated for their utility in normalizing the SARS-CoV-2 loads through developed direct and indirect approaches. Their utility in assessing the real-time population contributing to the wastewater was also evaluated. The best performed candidate was further tested for its capacity for improving correlation between normalized SARS-CoV-2 loads and the clinical cases reported in the City of Columbia, Missouri, a university town with a constantly fluctuated population. Our results showed that, except CRE, the direct and indirect normalization approaches using biomarkers allow accounting for the changes in wastewater dilution and differences in relative human waste input over time regardless flow volume and population at any given WWTP. Among selected biomarkers, PARA is the most reliable population biomarker in determining the SARS-CoV-2 load per capita due to its high accuracy, low variability, and high temporal consistency to reflect the change in population dynamics and dilution in wastewater. It also demonstrated its excellent utility for real-time assessment of the population contributing to the wastewater. In addition, the viral loads normalized by the PARA-estimated population significantly improved the correlation ( rho =0.5878, p <0.05) between SARS-CoV-2 load per capita and case numbers per capita.

Finally, pseudoviruses containing the spike amino acid sequence of these lineages were resistant to different classes of receptor binding domain neutralizing monoclonal antibodies.

The pilot study reported herein aimed to: (i) develop a reliable protocol for MPXV DNA detection in wastewater which would reduce false negative reporting, (ii) test this protocol on wastewater from various regions across the United States, and (iii) conduct a state of the science review of the current literature reporting on experimental methods for MPXV detection using WBE. Twenty-four-hour composite samples of untreated municipal wastewater were collected from the states of New Jersey, Georgia, Illinois, Texas, Arizona, and Washington beginning July 3rd, 2022 through October 16th, 2022 (n = 60). Samples underwent vacuum filtration, DNA extraction from captured solids, MPXV DNA pre-amplification, and qPCR analysis. Of the 60 samples analyzed, a total of eight (13%) tested positive for MPXV in the states of Washington, Texas, New Jersey, and Illinois. The presence of clade IIb MPXV DNA in these samples was confirmed via Sanger sequencing and integration of pre-amplification prior to qPCR decreased the rate of false negative detections by 87% as compared to qPCR analysis alone. Wastewater-derived detections of MPXV were compared to clinical datasets, with 50% of detections occurring as clinical cases were increasing/peaking and 50% occurring as clinical cases waned. Results from the literature review (n = 9 studies) revealed successful strategies for the detection of MPXV DNA in wastewater, however also emphasized a need for further method optimization and standardization.

We also were able to observe the early spread of variants of concern and the presence of recombinant lineages during the transitions between variants, both of which are challenging to analyze based on clinically-derived viral genomes.

One such protocol involves sample clarification by size fractionation using either low-speed centrifugation to produce a clarified supernatant or membrane filtration to produce an initial filtrate depleted of solids, eukaryotes and bacterial present in wastewater (WW), followed by concentration of virus particles by ultrafiltration of the above. While this approach has been successful in identifying viruses from WW, it assumes that majority of the viruses of interest should be present in the fraction obtained by ultrafiltration of the initial filtrate, with negligible loss of viral particles and viral diversity. We used WW samples collected in a population of ~700,000 in southwest USA between October 2019 and March 2021, targeting three non-enveloped viruses (enteroviruses [EV], canine picornaviruses [CanPV], and human adenovirus 41 [Ad41]), to evaluate whether size fractionation of WW prior to ultrafiltration leads to appreciable differences in the virus presence and diversity determined. We showed that virus presence or absence in WW samples in both portions (filter trapped solids [FTS] and filtrate) are not consistent with each other. We also found that in cases where virus was detected in both fractions, virus diversity (or types) captured either in FTS or filtrate were not consistent with each other. Hence, preferring one fraction of WW over the other can undermine the capacity of WBE to function as an early warning system and negatively impact the accurate representation of virus presence and diversity in a population.",LM013129,medRxiv : the preprint server for health sciences,2022

The public health response has been predominantly informed by surveillance of symptomatic individuals and contact tracing, with quarantine, and other preventive measures have then been applied to mitigate further spread. Non-traditional methods of surveillance such as genomic epidemiology and wastewater-based epidemiology (WBE) have also been leveraged during this pandemic. Genomic epidemiology uses high-throughput sequencing of SARS-CoV-2 genomes to inform local and international transmission events, as well as the diversity of circulating variants. WBE uses wastewater to analyse community spread, as it is known that SARS-CoV-2 is shed through bodily excretions. Since both symptomatic and asymptomatic individuals contribute to wastewater inputs, we hypothesized that the resultant pooled sample of population-wide excreta can provide a more comprehensive picture of SARS-CoV-2 genomic diversity circulating in a community than clinical testing and sequencing alone. In this study, we analysed 91 wastewater samples from 11 states in the USA, where the majority of samples represent Maricopa County, Arizona (USA). With the objective of assessing the viral diversity at a population scale, we undertook a single-nucleotide variant (SNV) analysis on data from 52 samples with >90% SARS-CoV-2 genome coverage of sequence reads, and compared these SNVs with those detected in genomes sequenced from clinical patients.

The wastewater-derived SARS-CoV-2 sequence data indicates there were more lineages circulating across the sampled communities than represented in the clinical-derived data. Principal coordinate analyses identified patterns in population structure based on genetic variation within the sequenced samples, with clear trends associated with increased diversity likely due to a higher number of infected individuals relative to the sampling dates.

Despite the numerous benefits, sources of variability in sample storage, handling, and processing methods can make WBE data difficult to generalize. We performed an experiment to determine sources of variability in WBE data including the impact of storage time, handling, and processing techniques on the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater influent from three wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) in North Carolina over 19 days. The SARS-CoV-2 concentration in influent samples held at 4°C did not degrade significantly over the 19-day experiment. Heat pasteurization did not significantly impact the concentration of SARS-CoV-2 at two of the three WWTP but did reduce viral recovery at the WWTP with the smallest population size served. On each processing date, one filter from each sample was processed immediately while a replicate filter was frozen at -80°C. Once processed, filters previously frozen were found to contain slightly higher concentrations (<0.2 log copies/L) than their immediately processed counterparts, indicating freezing filters is a viable method for delayed quantification and may even improve recovery at WWTP with low viral concentrations. Investigation of factors contributing to variability during sample processing indicated that analyst experience level contributed significantly (p<0.001) to accepted droplet generation while extraction efficiency and reverse transcription efficiency contributed significantly (p<0.05) to day-to-day SARS-CoV-2 variability. This study provides valuable practical information for minimizing decay and/or loss of SARS CoV-2 in wastewater influent while adhering to safety procedures, promoting efficient laboratory workflows, and accounting for sources of variability.",DA053899,PloS one,2022

To address this, we describe a generalizable bioinformatics-to-biology pipeline developed for the calibration and quality assurance of inactivated SARS-CoV-2 variant panels provided to Radical Acceleration of Diagnostics programs (RADx)-radical program awardees. A heuristic genetic analysis based on variant-defining mutations demonstrated the lowest genetic variance in the Nucleocapsid protein (Np)-C-terminal domain (CTD) across all SARS-CoV-2 variants. We then employed the Shannon entropy method on (Np) sequences collected from the major variants, verifying the CTD with lower entropy (less prone to mutations) than other Np regions. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies were raised against this target CTD antigen and used to develop an Enzyme-linked immunoassay (ELISA) test for SARS-CoV-2. Blinded Viral Quality Assurance (VQA) panels comprised of UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 variants (XBB.1.5, BF.7, BA.1, B.1.617.2, and WA1) and distractor respiratory viruses (CoV 229E, CoV OC43, RSV A2, RSV B, IAV H1N1, and IBV) were assembled by the RADx-rad Diagnostics core and tested using the ELISA described here. The assay tested positive for all variants with high sensitivity (limit of detection: 1.72-8.78 ng/mL) and negative for the distractor virus panel. Epitope mapping for the monoclonal antibodies identified a 20 amino acid antigenic peptide on the Np-CTD that an in-silico program also predicted for the highest antigenicity. This work provides a template for a bioinformatics pipeline to select genetic regions with a low propensity for mutation (low Shannon entropy) to develop robust 'pan-variant' antigen-based assays for viruses prone to high mutational rates.",LM013755,Viruses,2024

Summarizing clinical notes further assists healthcare professionals in pinpointing potential health risks and making better-informed decisions. This process contributes to reducing errors and enhancing patient outcomes by ensuring providers have access to the most pertinent and current patient data. Recent research has shown that incorporating instruction prompts with large language models (LLMs) substantially boosts the efficacy of summarization tasks. However, we show that this approach also leads to increased performance variance, resulting in significantly distinct summaries even when instruction prompts share similar meanings. To tackle this challenge, we introduce a model-agnostic Soft Prompt-BasedCalibration (SPeC) pipeline that employs soft prompts to lower variance while preserving the advantages of prompt-based summarization. Experimental findings on multiple clinical note tasks and LLMs indicate that our method not only bolsters performance but also effectively regulates variance across different LLMs, providing a more consistent and reliable approach to summarizing critical medical information.",LM013755,Journal of biomedical informatics,2024

The Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) is a federal law designed to protect sensitive health information by defining regulations for protected health information (PHI). However, it does not provide efficient tools for detecting or removing PHI before data sharing. One of the challenges in this area of research is the heterogeneous nature of PHI fields in data across different parties. This variability makes rule-based sensitive variable identification systems that work on one database fail on another. To address this issue, our paper explores the use of machine learning algorithms to identify sensitive variables in structured data, thus facilitating the de-identification process. We made a key observation that the distributions of metadata of PHI fields and non-PHI fields are very different. Based on this novel finding, we engineered over 30 features from the metadata of the original features and used machine learning to build classification models to automatically identify PHI fields in structured Electronic Health Record (EHR) data. We trained the model on a variety of large EHR databases from different data sources and found that our algorithm achieves 99% accuracy when detecting PHI-related fields for unseen datasets.

To address this, we propose a novel framework called CoD-MTL leveraging multi-task learning to model the semantic relationships between various CoD prediction tasks jointly. Specifically, we develop a novel tree distillation strategy for multi-task learning, which combines the strength of both the tree model and multi-task learning.

There are two main challenges in liver transplant: finding the best matching patient for a donor and ensuring transplant equity among different subpopulations. The current MELD scoring system evaluates a patient's mortality risk if not receiving an organ within 90 days. However, the donor-patient matching should also consider post-transplant risk factors, such as cardiovascular disease, chronic rejection, etc., which are all common complications after transplant. Accurate prediction of these risk scores remains a significant challenge. In this study, we used predictive models to solve the above challenges. Specifically, we proposed a deep learning model to predict multiple risk factors after a liver transplant. By formulating it as a multi-task learning problem, the proposed deep neural network was trained to simultaneously predict the five post-transplant risks and achieve equal good performance by exploiting task-balancing techniques. We also proposed a novel fairness-achieving algorithm to ensure prediction fairness across different subpopulations. We used electronic health records of 160,360 liver transplant patients, including demographic information, clinical variables, and laboratory values, collected from the liver transplant records of the United States from 1987 to 2018. The model's performance was evaluated using various performance metrics such as AUROC and AUPRC. Our experiment results highlighted the success of our multi-task model in achieving task balance while maintaining accuracy. The model significantly reduced the task discrepancy by 39 %. Further application of the fairness-achieving algorithm substantially reduced fairness disparity among all sensitive attributes (gender, age group, and race/ethnicity) in each risk factor. It underlined the potency of integrating fairness considerations into the task-balancing framework, ensuring robust and fair predictions across multiple tasks and diverse demographic groups.",LM013755,Journal of biomedical informatics,2024

Unfortunately, biases in medical predictions can lead to unfair treatment and widening disparities, underscoring the need for effective techniques to address these issues. To enhance fairness, we introduce a framework based on a Multiple Domain Adversarial Neural Network (MDANN), which incorporates multiple adversarial components. In an MDANN, an adversarial module is applied to learn a fair pattern by negative gradients back-propagating across multiple sensitive features (i.e., characteristics of individuals that should not be used to discriminate unfairly between individuals when making predictions or decisions.) We leverage loss functions based on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic Curve (AUC) to address the class imbalance, promoting equitable classification performance for minority groups (e.g., a subset of the population that is underrepresented or disadvantaged.) Moreover, we utilize pre-trained convolutional autoencoders (CAEs) to extract deep representations of data, aiming to enhance prediction accuracy and fairness. Combining these mechanisms, we alleviate biases and disparities to provide reliable and equitable disease prediction. We empirically demonstrate that the MDANN approach leads to better accuracy and fairness in predicting disease progression using brain imaging data for Alzheimer's Disease and Autism populations than state-of-the-art techniques.",LM013755,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2023

To address the challenge in tracking the vast amount of new research located in separate repositories, we developed outbreak.info Research Library, a standardized, searchable interface of COVID-19 and SARS-CoV-2 resources. Unifying metadata from sixteen repositories, we assembled a collection of over 350,000 publications, clinical trials, datasets, protocols, and other resources as of October 2022. We used a rigorous schema to enforce consistency across different sources and resource types and linked related resources. Researchers can quickly search the latest research across data repositories, regardless of resource type or repository location, via a search interface, public API, and R package. Finally, we discuss the challenges inherent in combining metadata from scattered and heterogeneous resources and provide recommendations to streamline this process to aid scientific research.",LM013755,bioRxiv : the preprint server for biology,2022

However, there are real-world risks of incorrect models being submitted to the learning process, due to either unforeseen accidents or malicious intent. This may reduce the incentives for institutions to participate in the federated modeling consortium. Existing methods to deal with this ""model misconduct"" issue mainly focus on modifying the learning methods, and therefore are more specifically tied with the algorithm.",LM013755,International journal of medical informatics,2021

Current centralized image sharing frameworks become dysfunctional if any part of the framework fails. Existing decentralized image sharing frameworks do not store the images on the blockchain, thus the data themselves are not highly available, immutable, and provable. Meanwhile, storing images on the blockchain provides availability/immutability/provenance to the images, yet produces challenges such as large-image handling, high viewing latency while viewing images, and software inconsistency while storing/loading images.",LM013755,International journal of medical informatics,2021

Molecular recognition agents that are specific for distinct viral proteins are critical components for rapid diagnostics and targeted therapeutics. In this work, we demonstrate the selection of novel DNA aptamers that bind to the SARS-CoV-2 spike glycoprotein with high specificity and affinity (<80 nM). Through binding assays and high resolution cryo-EM, we demonstrate that SNAP1 (SARS-CoV-2 spike protein N-terminal domain-binding aptamer 1) binds to the S N-terminal domain. We applied SNAP1 in lateral flow assays (LFAs) and ELISAs to detect UV-inactivated SARS-CoV-2 at concentrations as low as 5×105  copies mL-1 . SNAP1 is therefore a promising molecular tool for SARS-CoV-2 diagnostics.",LM013755,Angewandte Chemie (International ed. in English),2021
